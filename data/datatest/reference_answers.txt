Pittsburgh (ptsbr PITSburg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the secondmost populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68thmost populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the secondlargest in Pennsylvania, and the 26thlargest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater PittsburghWeirtonSteubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia.
Pittsburgh is known as "the Steel City" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineralrich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among bluecollar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburghbased corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]
Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo  Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.
Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name ptsbr PITSbr (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]
Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]
"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."[20]
From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "Pittsburg", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]

The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18thcentury Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]: 289
The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better source needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]
In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 17531754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named "Pittsborough".[28]
During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]
During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the MasonDixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.
On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]
Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh PostGazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.
The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[37] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[38]
The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46yearold local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.
In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.
Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and AfricanAmerican workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where AfricanAmerican workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]
The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.
In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighthlargest city, accounting for between onethird and onehalf of national steel output.
The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[42]
The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.
The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, nonHispanic whites were 90.6 of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the AfricanAmerican Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95 percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45]
During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off."[48]
Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11]
In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcaremedicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrialera highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.
During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10 appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[49]
In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[50]
Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.
The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[51] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as "the Point." The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.
Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with twolane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to "hills," "heights," or similar features.[a]
The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[52] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[53]
Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bikerunning trail.
The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[54] and four main areas surrounding itCentral, North SideNorth Hills, South SideSouth Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.[55]
Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150 m), with the U.S. Steel Tower being the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[56] The Cultural District spans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothicstyle glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[57] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.
The North Side, originally the independent Allegheny City until being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with wellpreserved 19thcentury homes. It hosts attractions like Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, the Andy Warhol Museum, and the National Aviary, among others.[58]
The South Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.[59] In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into the SouthSide Works mixeduse development.
The East End includes key institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, and Phipps Conservatory. It features many parks, including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shadyside. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland is home to several universities and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an openair marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various AfricanAmerican jazz clubs.[61]
The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.
Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."[64] In its postindustrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.
Under the Kppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hotsummer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 C (32 F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the 3 C (27 F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50.[73]
The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24hour average of 73.2 F (22.9 C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 F (32 C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24hour average is 28.8 F (1.8 C), and lows of 0 F (18 C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from 22 F (30 C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 F (39 C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is 3 F (19 C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the alltime record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 F (28 C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 F (38 C) readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]
Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 191819 to 80 in (200 cm) in 195051.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percentaverage possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45) is similar to Seattle (49).
The American Lung Association's 2024 "State of the Air" report, covering data from 2020 to 2022, indicated that while Pittsburgh's air quality is poor, it is improving. The city ranked 26th for shortterm particle pollution, earning an F grade, and 19th for yearround particle pollution. It received a D grade for ozone pollution, ranking 50th for ozone smog.[81][82] However, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.[83][84]
Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.[85] It also revealed that 38 of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70 in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.[85] Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[86]
As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between 10 and 13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests 850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.[87]
Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure.[88] Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.[89] Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.[90][91] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers per year, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[92] The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a 2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.[93][94][95]
The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.[96][97][98] While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.[99][100][101] In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[102] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[102]
There remains concern among residents over the longterm effects of this lead, particularly for children.[103] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated bloodlead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[103][104]
At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6 since 2000; 66.0 of the population was White, 25.8 Black or African American, 0.2 American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4 Asian, 0.3 Other, and 2.3 mixed; in 2020, 2.3 of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race. NonHispanic whites were 64.8 of the population in 2010,[108] compared to 78.7 in 1970.[109] By the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[107] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7 nonHispanic white, 23.0 Black or African American, 5.8 Asian, and 3.2 Hispanic or Latino American of any race.
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7), Irish (15.8), Italian (11.8), Polish (8.4), and English (4.6), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22 GermanAmerican, 15.4 Italian American and 11.6 Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest ItalianAmerican communities in the nation,[115] and the fifthlargest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census.[116] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States.[117] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country.
Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.[118]
In 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9 had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2 were married couples living together, 16.5 had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4 were nonfamilies. 39.4 of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7 had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9 under the age of 18, 14.8 from 18 to 24, 28.6 from 25 to 44, 20.3 from 45 to 64, and 16.4 who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.
The median income for a household in the city was 28,588, and the median income for a family was 38,795. Males had a median income of 32,128 versus 25,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was 18,816. About 15.0 of families and 20.4 of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5 of those under the age of 18 and 13.5 ages 65 or older. By the 2019 American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to 53,799.[119] Families had a median income of 68,922; marriedcouple families had a median income of 93,500; and nonfamily households had a median income of 34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over 100,000 a year.[120][121]
As of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and Uptown Pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits, Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh's most denselypopulated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.[122]
Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are from China, India, Korea and Italy.[123]
Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the Lower Hill District underwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[13] This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.[124]
In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[125] By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[125]
These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and lowincome populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[124][126] The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[127]
According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78 of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42 professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32 professing Catholic beliefs. while 18 claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4 of the population.[128]
According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 "Catholics"; 326,125 "Mainline Protestants"; 174,119 "Evangelical Protestants;" 20,976 "Black Protestants;" and 16,405 "Orthodox Christians," with 996,826 listed as "unclaimed" and 16,405 as "other" in the metro area.[118] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200.[129] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1 of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center.[130][131]
Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its centurylong steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded 10.8 billion in 2007,[132] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[133] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the secondbest U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[134] or the American Dream.[135] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 19181998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[136] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[137] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as "the poster child for managing industrial transition".[138] Other major cities in the northeast and midwest have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[139]
The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10 of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: "That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s."[140]
Education is a major economic driver in the region. The largest single employer in education is the University of Pittsburgh, with 10,700 employees.[141]
Ten Fortune 500 companies call the Pittsburgh area home.[142] They are (in alphabetical order):  Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA), Arconic Corporation (NYSE: ARNC), Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS),  The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC), PNC Financial Services (NYSE: PNC), PPG Industries (NYSE: PPG), U.S. Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), Viatris (NASDAQ: VRTS), Wabtec Corporation (NYSE: WAB), and WESCO International (WYSE: WCC).[143]

The Pittsburgh designated market area (DMA) is the 22ndlargest in the U.S. with 1,163,150 homes (1.045 of the total U.S.).[242] The major network television stations include KDKATV 2 (CBS), WTAE 4 (ABC), WPXI 11 (NBC), WINPTV 16 (Ion), WPKDTV 19 (Independent), WPNT 22 (The CWMyNetworkTV), WPCB 40 (Cornerstone), and WPGHTV 53 (Fox). KDKATV, WINPTV, and WPCB are ownedandoperated by their respective networks.
WQED 13 is the local PBS member station in Pittsburgh. It was established on April 1, 1954, and was the first communitysponsored television station and the fifth public station in the United States. The station has produced much original content for PBS, including Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, several National Geographic specials, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?[243]
A wide variety of radio stations serve the Pittsburgh market. The first was KDKA 1020 AM, also the world's first commercially licensed radio station, which began airing on November 2, 1920.[244] Other stations include KQV 1410 AM (news), WBGG 970 AM (sports), KDKAFM 93.7 FM (sports), WKSTFM 96.1 FM (Top 40), WAMOAM 660 AM and 107.3 FM (urban contemporary) WBZZ 100.7 FM (adult contemporary), WDVE 102.5 FM (album rock), WPGB 104.7 FM (Country), and WXDX 105.9 FM (modern rock). There are also three public radio stations in the area: WESA 90.5 FM (National Public Radio affiliate), WQED 89.3 FM (classical), and WYEP 91.3 FM (adult alternative). Three noncommercial stations are run by Carnegie Mellon University (WRCT 88.3 FM), the University of Pittsburgh (WPTS 92.1 FM), and Point Park University (WPPJ 670 AM).
Pittsburgh's 116yearold film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[245] According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including The Mothman Prophecies, Wonder Boys,[246] Dogma,[246] Hoffa, The Silence of the Lambs,[246] Sudden Death, Flashdance,[246] Southpaw, Striking Distance, Mrs. Soffel, Jack Reacher, Inspector Gadget, The Next Three Days, The Perks of Being a Wallflower,[246] Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Fences.[246][247] Pittsburgh became "Gotham City" in 2011 during filming of The Dark Knight Rises.[147] George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his Living Dead series.[248] From 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh welcomed a series of major film and television productions like Fences, Mindhunter, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Sweet Girl, and I'm Your Woman, significantly contributing to the local economy.[249][250]
Film production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25 tax credit incentive established in 2007.[251][252] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over 500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[253] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over 41 billion to them.[252]
Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[254][255] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University  Cinema  Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh  Film Studies.[256][257]
Moreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[258][259][260][261][262] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[263]
The city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[264] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[265] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, and Novec.[266]
The two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882). Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among U.S. News  World Report's "Honor Roll" every year since 2000.[citation needed]
The first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic PlainGeneral Edward Hand Hospitalserved the area from 1777 to 1845.[267] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first "Mercy Hospital".[268] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[26] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[269]
In 1980, UPMC announced a 250 million (1.08 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[270] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5yearold Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[271] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heartlung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a 230 million (660 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)and first publiccross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[272] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[273]
The 80 million (146 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers  Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its 30 million (53.3 million today), 5floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The 130 million (227 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8year, 420 million (699 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies  health information systems.[citation needed]
In 2009, the 600 million (876 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[274] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[275] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[276]
While he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.
UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heartlung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6yearold Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heartlung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heartliverkidney transplant (1989), the world's first heartliver transplant on an infant (1997),[277] the first pediatric heartdouble lungliver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[278][279]
The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[280]
Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[281] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title "City of Bridges".[282] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern "entrance" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's BlueRedSilver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated JL Steel Company bridge has been a key trafficrunningbiking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[283]
Pittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26thlargest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 minutes, while 23 of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33 of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11 travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[284]
Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the "parkways." Interstate 376 is both the "parkway east" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the "parkway west" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The "parkway north" is Interstate 279 connecting to I79. The "crosstown" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45milelong and 70milelong expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangularshaped "beltway" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the MonFayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The nonexpressway PittsburghAllegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.
Pittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh.
Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), YoungstownWarren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), AkronCanton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), JohnstownCambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).
Amtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City.
Megabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[285]
Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore  Ohio Station, Pittsburgh  Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station.
Pittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20thlargest metropolitan area, it is the 11thlargest transit agency in the United States.[286] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly aboveground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[287] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a nonprofit preservation trust,[288] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.
The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the "T") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.
Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.
Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's secondlargest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh.
The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20thlargest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011. The port ranked ninthlargest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[289]

The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Jadeog in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi.
Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow.  The region saw the shortlived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.  By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel.
Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the "Arsenal of Democracy", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.
Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65 of its residents are of European descent and 35 are minorities.
For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. PaleoIndians conducted a huntergatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]
By 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nationsbased south of the Great Lakes in presentday New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds.  Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]
In 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29 km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]
Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]: 289
Sawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300400 residents.[9]
The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]
Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at presentday Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80mile (130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail[12] now known as Nemacolin's Trail. The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek, was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as Fort Burd (now Brownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock's Road a few years later through presentday New Stanton. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.
The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.[6] Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.[12] De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory.[13]
In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At presentday Erie, Pennsylvania, an advance party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.[14]
Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley, Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw.[15] Accompanied by Christopher Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753.
As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers,  the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water;  a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building.
Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then Fort Le Boeuf. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.[15]
Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation[17] at the site of presentday Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only halfbuilt by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne.[14][15]
Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his secondincommand, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.[18] After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War (17541763), or, the Seven Years' War, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.[15][19]
In 1755, the Braddock Expedition was launched, accompanied by Virginia militia officer George Washington. Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains. Braddock's Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the future National Road (US40). The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at Braddock's Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne.[20] In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded.[21] The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.[15]
On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning, and in the summer of 1758, British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.[21] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 1314, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne.[21] The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, "Pittsborough" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh).[11][15] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.[11] The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat.[15] They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River.
In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the "lower town", near the fort's ramparts, and the "upper town", along the Monongahela as far as presentday Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]: 148
After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indianoccupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no BritishAmerican settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.[15]
The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown.[21] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were EnglishAmerican, another third were ScotchIrish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.[23] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4]
Increasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.[4]
With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.[4]
After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.[24]
The village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.[25]
Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The shortlived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]
The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building oceangoing vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]
Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]
The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing 764K in iron; 249K in brass and tin, and 235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]
Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in eastwest commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the "City of bridges" over its two rivers.[citation needed] On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.[27]
Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high.[33]
Like many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.[34] Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing 9M in damages.[31] As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (presentday North Side).[27] In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]
The iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s.
Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was "largely Scotch Irish". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and "developed their own sense of uniqueness."[36]
New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major ScotchIrish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 18131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 18061882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the "ScotsIrish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society."[37]
In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced cokefire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included ironclad warships and the world's first 21" gun.[38] By war's end, over onehalf of the steel and more than onethird of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]
Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh.  George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch  Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon  Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]
Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their massproduction counterparts.[42]
Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craftorganized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large massproduction plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]
Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995).  Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's workerresidents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]
A further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley.   It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]
By about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region.   Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]
Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]
During the mid19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]
As a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots.[50] Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.
In 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when Carnegie Steel Company's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike.  Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression, as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized H.J. Heinz workers, with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance.
Andrew Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland and a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for 250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.[51] He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]
The third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]
By 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]
During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, antiestablishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.
During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term "Speakeasy", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]
The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]
The Pittsburgh PostGazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]
During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]
In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]
To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed "Millionaire's Row" because of the many mansions lining the street.
On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused 3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]
Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourthtallest educational building, the 42story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]
Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the AustroHungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in workingclass areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28 of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39]
The years 19161940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4 of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.[63][64]
Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:
The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:
The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District. It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s.[39]
Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,[67] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.[68][69]
Joseph Guffey, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only "a challenge" but also "an opportunity". He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.[70]
Pittsburgh was at the center of the "Arsenal of Democracy" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]
David Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's workingclass because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from ItalianAmerican organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]
Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the "Smoky City", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.  Civic leaders, notably Mayor David L. Lawrence, elected in 1945, Richard K. Mellon, chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin[74][75] began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city[11] in unforeseen ways.
"Renaissance I" began in 1946.  Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin.  By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal.[27]
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninetyfive acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[76] Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.
In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20story public housing apartments, and a convoluted roadway system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district.  In the span of just a few years during the mid1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979.
Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans.  The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including the Mexican War Streets, Allegheny West, and Manchester, were spared. The center of Allegheny City, with its culturally and socially important buildings, was not as lucky. All of the buildings, with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office, the Carnegie Library, and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the "pedestrianized" Allegheny Center Mall and apartments.
The city's industrial base continued to grow in the postwar era[77] partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC.[78][79] Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s.[11] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium.[27] In 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed.[80] Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.
Like most major cities, Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the innercity black neighborhoods.[81]
During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American minimills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel.[citation needed] Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful governmentcorporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the 1973 oil crisis, and increasing use of other materials.[11][82]  The era began with the RIDC's "Building on Basics" report in 1974.[83]
Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a nowoutdated manufacturing base that had been overexpanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and workrule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable "minimills" and nonunion mills with lower labor costs.[82]
Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S.[84] Following the 19811982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.[82] The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed.[85][86] The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laidoff workers took lowerpaying, nonunion jobs.[87] Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.[88]
In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.
Top corporate headquarters such as Gulf Oil (1985), Koppers (1987), Westinghouse (1996) and Rockwell International (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the "brain drain") as well as massive charitable contributions by the "home based" companies to local cultural and educational institutions.  At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier.  Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day.
Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the Edgar Thomson Works in nearby Braddock.
Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most undergraduate and graduate school national rankings, The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University.  Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward hightechnology fields.[89]  Other regional collegiate institutions include Robert Morris University, Chatham University, Carlow University,  Point Park University, La Roche College, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the Community College of Allegheny County.
Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (26,000 employees) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System (13,000 employees).[90][91]
Despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.  In the mid1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies.  Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a 1mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh.  In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixeduse historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.  Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River, opposite the Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh). Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a 100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people  teachers, students, adults, and visitors  to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.[92]
During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.
In 1985, the J  L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.[27] In the 1980s, the "Renaissance II" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as PPG Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side JL mills were cleared.[27] In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened.[27] In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League.[93]
Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.[94]
Presentday Pittsburgh, with a diversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine and  education and culture, has been ranked as one of the World's Most Livable Cities.[95] Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities.  Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry.[96] Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh.  As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies.  The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center.  In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian subcontinent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.[97]

Pittsburgh,  city, seat (1788) of Allegheny county, southwestern Pennsylvania, U.S. The city is located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which unite at the point of the Golden Triangle (the business district) to form the Ohio River. A city of hills, parks, and valleys, it is the centre of an urban industrial complex that includes the surrounding cities of Aliquippa (northwest), New Kensington (northeast), McKeesport (southeast), and Washington (southwest) and the borough of Wilkinsburg (east). Inc. borough, 1794; city, 1816. Area city, 58 square miles (150 square km). Pop. (2010) 305,704; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,370,930.
Algonquian and Iroquoianspeaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.
Pittsburghs strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the citys economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the Iron City. The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.
After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburghs population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881.
By 1900 the citys population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded onefourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smokepollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power.
By the late 1970s and early 80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeareda result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industriesthough metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained importantand on such hightechnology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nations largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.
Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University of Pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).
Central to the citys cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburghborn artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performs at Heinz Hall, a restored movie theatre.
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses. The citys zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two new sports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle: PNC Park is home of the Pirates, the citys professional baseball team, and Acrisure Stadium houses the Steelers, its professional football team. The Penguins, Pittsburghs professional ice hockey team, plays at PPG Paints Arena. Popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on Pittsburghs waterways and Kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in West Mifflin.Pittsburgh

We're home alone, so come over for a variety show featuring improv, live music, standup comedy, and vintage videos from those wonderfully horrible 90s. And 80s. And maybe like some early 2000s. But nothing after 2002. We do have integrity. Join us and special guests as we celebrate the media that made us who we are (for better or worse)! The Latchkey Kids were voted one of the Best Comedy Troupes of 2021 by the readers of Pittsburgh City Paper. Our parents are very proud, but they do wish we wouldn't curse so much.

THE 2017
GREATER PITTSBURGH
JEWISH COMMUNITY
STUDY
Matthew Boxer
Matthew A. Brookner

Leonard Saxe
2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
2018 Brandeis University
Steinhardt Social Research Institute
www.brandeis.edussri
Established in 2005 and housed at the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies, the Steinhardt Social
Research Institute (SSRI) uses innovative research methods to collect and analyze sociodemographic
data on the Jewish community.
The Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies (CMJS), founded in 1980, is dedicated to providing
independent, highquality research on issues related to contemporary Jewish life.
Revised March 20, 2018
Version 1.1
2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh has taken the lead for the past decade on measuring
our communitys progress by developing the Community Scorecard. This 2017 Pittsburgh Jewish
Community Study is the next step in a continuous process to provide real facts for the Jewish
Federation, Jewish organizations, synagogues, and interested individuals to make informed
decisions based on data. But now the real work begins: to leverage the strengths that make our
community topnotch and to seize opportunities that address areas for improvement.
We are grateful to many people who helped bring this study to fruition. Our thanks to the Jewish
Community Foundation of the Jewish Federation, that funded this project in its entirety, the first
of its kind in more than 15 years. Our thanks as well go to the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish
Studies and Steinhardt Social Research Institute at Brandeis University for shepherding the
research, patiently answering our questions and bringing their expertise to our work. Most of all,
thanks to our volunteers and to you, the Jewish community, for participating and for supporting
this project.
There are many questions that come from what we learn in these pages. For example, how will we
continue to foster Jewish education with a changed population of schoolage Jewish children? How
will we welcome interfaith families and those who identify as just Jewish? What will be our
approach to synagogues as the number of Jews belonging to synagogues has declined? Where,
throughout the greater Jewish Pittsburgh community, are the gaps in services?
Take your time to familiarize yourself with these numbers. Ask questions. Start conversations. The
full report can be found at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh's website, www.jfedpgh.org.
Bring your own experience and understanding to the study. But be open to new and surprising
facts. Please join us as we strive to become the BEST Jewish community of 49,200 possible. To do
so, your participation is invaluable.

Jewish Federation Acknowledgments
2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The Brandeis research team is grateful to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh for the
opportunity to collaborate to develop and conduct the 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community
Study. The study was proposed and sponsored by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh,
whose staff, Board of Directors, and community study committee provided valuable input on the
study design, questionnaire, and report. We are particularly grateful to Community Scorecard
Director Raimy Rubin, Committee Chair Evan Indianer, and Cindy Shapira, Chair of the
Federation Board of Directors when the study began, who helped us learn about the community
and ensured that our work would be of the highest quality and utility for the Pittsburgh Jewish
community. We appreciate the generosity of the organizations that shared contact information with
us for the purposes of this study. Finally, we thank the 2,111 respondents who completed the
survey. Without their willingness to spend time answering numerous questions about their lives,
there could be no study.
We appreciate the efforts of the staff of Abt Associates, who served as the call center for this
study. We were pleased to work with Benjamin Phillips, our former colleague at CMJSSSRI, who
directed the project at Abt Associates, assisted by Valrie Horton. Dennis Daly oversaw
administration of the data collection operation.
This project could not have been conducted without the assistance of a large group of our
colleagues and students at the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies and Steinhardt Social
Research Institute. We deeply appreciate their efforts. Elizabeth Tighe, Daniel Parmer, and Raquel
Magidin led the efforts of the American Jewish Population Project team to develop the population
estimates for this study. Matthew Feinberg ably managed the process of combining lists and
deduplicating them. Camille Evans, Lev PaascheOrlow, and Tamar Shachaf Schneider helped
prepare mailings for the primary sample and cleaned data. Camille Evans, Yaoyao Gao, Jeff Hart,
Leora Kagedan, Eve Litvak, Lev PaascheOrlow, Tamar Shachaf Schneider, Joanna Spyra, and Gal
Zahori spent countless hours searching for missing contact information for members of the
sample. Breanna Vizlakh prepared a Russianlanguage version of the survey, which Sofiya
Nuryyeva used to complete several interviews with respondents over the phone. Jeff Hart, Tamar
Shachaf Schneider, Joanna Spyra, and Gal Zahori coded responses to openended questions in the
survey. Jeff also developed Stata code to simplify the compiling of the Codebook and Comparison
Charts. Naomi Weinblatt helped to prepare tables for the report. Deborah Grant provided editorial
advice and feedback, and she and Masha Lokshin organized the report for its final layout. Masha
Lokshin and Ilana Friedman provided logistical support throughout the study.
Special thanks go to Sarah Harpaz, whose dedication to our work is deeply appreciated. Sarah
managed the logistics of the study from Brandeis, liaising with the call center; fielding questions,
concerns, compliments, and complaints from members of the sample; helping with reminders;
assisting in the development and testing of the questionnaire; building the maps; and participating
in countless other tasks necessary to the proper conduct of the study.

1  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Executive Summary
The 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study was developed to provide communal
leaders, planners, and members with understanding of the size and character of the community.
The Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies and Steinhardt Social Research Institute at Brandeis
University conducted the study on behalf of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.
Interviews with over 2,100 Jewish households residing in the Pittsburgh area form the basis of the
report.
Key findings include:
Greater Pittsburghs Jewish community numbers nearly 50,000 Jewish adults and children
in nearly 27,000 households. Greater Pittsburghs Jews constitute a little over 2 of the area
population. The Jewish community has grown 17 since its last community study in 2002.
The composition of the Jewish community has changed since 2002. The largest shares of the
population are adults ages 1829 and 6069. Because there are fewer adults in their 30s and 40s than
there were in 2002, there are also fewer children. However, nearly 40 of Jewish children in the
community are ages 05. Newcomers to the community are also replacing those who move away.
Both developments signal that the growth of the community is likely to continue.
The community is spreading out geographically. Younger adults and families are more
prevalent in the city, and older adults reside in greater numbers in the suburbs and outlying areas.
The Pittsburgh Jewish community is highly educated. Pittsburgharea Jewish adults have even
higher levels of educational attainment than the US Jewish community as a whole, with 84 of
local Jewish adults having at least a college degree compared with 58 of all US Jewish adults.
The Pittsburgh Jewish community is mostly middle class. Onethird (33) of Pittsburgharea
Jews describe themselves as prosperous (7) or living very comfortably (26), and another 45
say they are living reasonably comfortably. Fifteen percent say they are just getting along, and 8
say they are nearly poor or poor.
Geographic Distribution
The Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, as defined by the Federation catchment area, includes
all of Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties. The present report
compares Squirrel Hill, the rest of the city of Pittsburgh, the South Hills, the North Hills, and the
rest of the region. Squirrel Hill has historically been the center of Jewish life in Greater Pittsburgh
and remains home to 26 of all Pittsburgharea Jewish households. Another 31 of Jewish
households are in the rest of the city of Pittsburgh, primarily in neighborhoods surrounding
Squirrel Hill. The South Hills area is now home to 20 of all Jewish households, and 9 reside in
the North Hills. The remaining 14 of Jewish households are distributed through the rest of the
fivecounty area.
2  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Children
Overall, 76 of children in Jewish households are being raised Jewish in some way.
Seventyone percent are being raised exclusively Jewish, either by religion (56) or culturally
(15).
Among children with intermarried parents, 33 are being raised exclusively Jewish, either
by religion or culturally. Another 11 are being raised both Jewish and in another religion. Fifty
one percent are being raised in no religion or with no decision yet made about how to raise the
children. Six percent are being raised in a religion other than Judaism. (The total adds up to more
than 100 due to rounding.) The proportion of children raised Jewish by intermarried parents is
lower than the national average.
Overall, 52 of Jewish children in grades K12 participated in at least one Jewish
educational program in the past year. Fortyfive percent of Jewish children in grades K12 are
enrolled in Jewish parttime school, day school, or a Jewish tutoring program, and 41 participated
in a Jewish youth group or attended a Jewish day camp or overnight camp. Twentyeight percent of
preschoolaged Jewish children are enrolled in a Jewish preschool.
Jewish Engagement and Synagogue Membership
Jewish behavior includes family and homebased practices, ritual practices, personal activities, and
organizational participation. Examining an index that combines multiple measures of Jewish life,
members of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community can be thought of as displaying five patterns
of Jewish engagement. These groupings provide a deeper way of understanding Jewish engagement
aside from denominational affiliation and ritual behavior.
Pittsburgharea Jews display similar patterns of denominational affiliation as the overall US
Jewish population. Thirtyfour percent of Jewish adults identify as Reform, more than any other
denomination. Thirty percent say they have no specific denomination.
In the Greater Pittsburgh area, 35 of households belong to a synagogue or another Jewish
worship community of some type. These households include 38 of Jewish adults, similar to
the national average (39). The proportion of member households has declined since 2002 (53).
The largest group of synagogue members (19 of households) are duespaying members
of local brickandmortar synagogues. The remaining synagogue members (16 of
households) belong to independent minyanim or chavurot, Chabad, or nonlocal congregations, or
consider themselves members of brickandmortar synagogues but do not pay dues.
Community
Jewish community ties are important to Pittsburgharea Jews. Eighty percent of Jewish adults
say that being Jewish is somewhat or very much a matter of community. About twothirds (63)
say it is important to feel connected to the Jewish community in Pittsburgh, and 43 feel
3  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
somewhat or very connected to the local Jewish community. Twothirds (65) feel very connected
to the global Jewish community.
Nearly onethird (30) of Pittsburgharea Jewish households say they are members of the
JCC. This includes 20 who say they pay dues, and 10 who consider themselves members but
do not pay dues. Membership rates are highest in Squirrel Hill (40), the South Hills (29),
and the rest of the city of Pittsburgh (25).
Nearly onethird (32) say they are members of another Jewish organization besides a
synagogue or the JCC. Half of senior citizens belong to a Jewish organization other than a
synagogue or the JCC.
Thirtynine percent of Jewish adults engaged in some volunteer activity in the past month,
either with a Jewish organization or with a nonJewish organization. Eighteen percent volunteered
with a Jewish organization in any capacity, including 15 who have taken on leadership roles such
as serving on a board or committee. Twentyeight percent volunteered for nonJewish
organizations, including 8 who also volunteered for Jewish organizations.
Ninetythree percent of Jewish adults made charitable donations in the past year. Seventy
six percent donated to at least one Jewish organization; 63 donated to a Jewish organization that
serves the Pittsburgharea Jewish community. The causes volunteers and donors deem most
important are education (83 very important), healthmedical causes (79), social justice (73),
and womens rights (72).
Israel
Approximately threefifths (59) of Pittsburgharea Jewish adults have visited Israel or
lived there. Onequarter (24) have visited once. Another quarter (28) have visited multiple
times, and 7 lived there at some point, including 3 who are Israeli citizens. The proportion of
Pittsburgharea Jewish adults who have visited Israel has increased since 2002 (44).
Approximately onethird (33) of Pittsburgharea Jewish adults feel very connected to
Israel. By contrast, 17 feel not at all connected to Israel.
Health and WellBeing
The majority of Pittsburgharea Jewish households are financially comfortable. Onethird
(33) describe themselves as being prosperous (7) or very comfortable (26), and another 45
say they are living reasonably comfortably. There are some households who are struggling and say
they are just getting by (15) or are nearly poor or poor (8).
Economic insecurity is a concern for some households. Onequarter (25) of Jewish
households lack sufficient savings to cover three months of expenses, and 13 say they could not
cover an emergency 400 expense with cash, money currently in a bank account, or on a credit card
they could pay in full. Thirteen percent skipped at least one rent, mortgage, or utility payment in
4  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
the past year due to financial hardship. Four percent of households say that financial constraints
have prevented them from participating in Jewish life in some way in the Pittsburgh area in the past
year.
Onequarter (25) of Jewish households include at least one person with a chronic health
issue or disability. This number includes those who are limited in the amount of work, school, or
housework they can do as a result of an impairment, disability, or chronic physical or mental health
issue. Eight percent of households indicate that health issues have constrained them from
participating in Jewish life in some way in the Pittsburgh area in the past year.

Chapter 1. Introduction
The goals of the 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study were to understand the size
and character of the local Jewish population and to provide the community with highquality data
to drive decisionmaking for policy and planning. Multiple methods were used to generate
population estimates of the Jewish community and to assess the attitudes and behaviors of those
who identify as Jewish. The central component of the study was a survey that asked a broad set of
questions about Jewish identity, attitudes, and engagement with the community. The survey was
administered both as a telephone interview and as an online instrument.
The study was designed to help the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community and its communal
agencies learn about the size and demographic characteristics of their community, synagogue and
other affiliations, interest in and utilization of programs and services, and ways that Pittsburgh Jews
relate to one another. The findings are intended to inform communal planning and resource
allocation.
About This Study
This study follows an enduring tradition of efforts to describe and understand the Greater
Pittsburgh Jewish community. Earlier demographic studies were conducted in 1938, 1963, 1984,
and 2002 (reports are held at the Berman Jewish Databank). Since 2014, the Pittsburgh Jewish
Community Scorecard has tracked key metrics in Jewish engagement, affiliation, social services and
philanthropy, connection to the surrounding community, and capacity building. All communities
change considerably over time and these studies have provided essential data for planning
purposes. The 2017 study, initiated and funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh
(Federation), established the following goals:
To estimate the size and geographic distribution of the Jewish population
To develop a portrait of the sociodemographic characteristics, affiliations, attitudes,
behaviors, needs, and interests of the Jewish community as a whole and of subgroups
within the community
To identify emerging needs and changes in the community over time
To help the community make datadriven decisions for communal planning
The study was conducted by researchers from the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies
Steinhardt Social Research Institute (CMJSSSRI) at Brandeis University. Informed by previous
research and in consultation with Federation, its community study technical committee, and
representatives of Jewish organizations in the Greater Pittsburgh area, CMJSSSRI developed a
research strategy and survey instrument to address the communitys needs.
6  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Methodology
Community studies rely upon scientific methods to collect information from selected members of
the community and, from those responses, extrapolate a generalized portrait of the community as a
whole. Over time, it has become increasingly complicated to conduct such studies, and particularly
to obtain an unbiased, representative sample of community members. The 2017 Greater Pittsburgh
Jewish Community Study used innovative methods developed by CMJSSSRI 1 to overcome these
challenges.
The central obstacle is that Jews are a relatively small group and traditional methods for identifying
a representative sample of Jews are no longer feasible. The classic methodology, randomdigit
dialing (RDD), relies on telephone calls to randomly selected households in a specified geographic
area and phone interviews with household members. Changes in telephone technology (e.g., caller
ID) and fewer people answering the phone for unknown callers have reduced response rates for
such surveys below 10.2 An even greater challenge is that over half of all households no longer
have landline telephones and rely exclusively on cell phones.3 Because of phone number
portability,4 cell phones frequently have an area code, exchange, and billing address that are not
associated with the geographic location in which the user resides. In Jewish community studies,
this has proven to be especially problematic for ensuring that the survey reaches young adults and
newcomers to the community. It is no longer possible to select a range of phone numbers and
assume the owners of those numbers will live in the specified area and be willing to answer the
phone and complete a survey.
This study addresses these challenges by using several methods, described in detail in Appendix A:
Enhanced RDD. The enhanced RDD method synthesized hundreds of national surveys
conducted by government agencies and other organizations that include questions about
religious identification. The synthesis used the data from these surveys along with
information collected from Pittsburgharea residents to estimate the size of the Jewish
population in the region.
Comprehensive listbased sample. The study selected respondents primarily based on
their appearance on the membership and contact lists of dozens of Pittsburgharea Jewish
organizations. This approach ensured that anyone in the Greater Pittsburgh area who has
had even minimal contact with any area Jewish organization was represented.
Ethnic names sample. The comprehensive listbased sample was supplemented with a
list of households in the area comprised of individuals who have a distinctly Jewish first or
last name. Such households typically make up 2025 of Jewish households in a
community but are not significantly different from Jewish households that do not have
distinctive Jewish names.5
Multiple survey modes. CMJS approached survey participants by postal mail, phone, and
email. Multiple attempts were made to reach each respondent and update contact
information and the respondents status when initial efforts were unsuccessful.
In consultation with Federation, the geographic focus of the 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish
Community Study included households in Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington, and
Westmoreland Counties. This area is distinct from the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area,
7  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
which also includes Armstrong and Fayette Counties. Although this study focused solely on the
fivecounty area defined by Federation, anyone who lived in an adjacent county and was associated
in any way with a local Jewish organization was still eligible to participate in the survey.
The study was based on a sampling frame of over 81,000 households. From this frame, two
samples were drawn: a primary sample of 14,562 households who were contacted by postal mail,
phone, and email, and a supplementary sample of 14,997 households who were contacted by email
only. The primary sample was designed to be representative of the entire community and was used
as the basis for population estimates and analyses of the community as a whole. The response rate6
for this sample was 28.6 (AAPOR RR3) and the cooperation rate7 was 75.3 (AAPOR CR1). In
total, over 2,000 Jewish households were interviewed (Table 1.1). Because households in the
supplemental sample were only contacted by email, highly engaged households were expected to be
more likely to complete the survey. Accordingly, statistical adjustments were used to account for
the different likelihood of response in the two samples. Survey weights were developed to ensure
that the full sampleprimary and supplemental combined represented the entire community in
terms of key factors including age, Jewish denomination, and synagogue membership.
Throughout this report, for purposes of analysis and reporting, estimates about the entire
community were derived solely from the primary sample. The combined, or full, sample was used
for analyses of subgroupssuch as families with childrenwhere the increased number of
respondents supported more robust analysis.
Undercounted Populations
Although the goal of the study was to develop a comprehensive understanding of the Jewish
community, some groups are nevertheless likely to be undercounted andor underrepresented. In
particular, residents of institutional settings such as college dormitories, hospitals, and nursing
homes, as well as adults who have never associated with any Jewish organization in the Greater
Pittsburgh area are less likely to have been identified and contacted to complete the survey.
Although we cannot produce a completely accurate estimate of these individuals, the undercounts
are unlikely to introduce significant bias into the reported estimates. Where appropriate, we have
noted the limitations of the methods.

How to Read This Report
Community studies are household surveys. They are designed to represent the views of the entire
population by interviewing a randomly selected sample of households from the community. To
extrapolate respondent data to the entire community, the data are adjusted (i.e., weighted) by
assigning each respondent a weight so that hisher responses represent the proportion of the
overall community that has similar demographic characteristics. The weighted respondent thus
stands in for that segment of the population, and not only the household from which it was
collected. (See Appendix A for more detail.) Unless otherwise specified, this report presents
weighted survey data in the form of percentages or proportions. These data should be read not
as the percentage or proportion of respondents who answered each question in a given
way, but as the percentage or proportion of the population that it is estimated would
answer each question in that way had each member of the population been surveyed.
No estimate should be considered an exact measurement. The reported estimate of any value,
known as a point estimate, is the most likely value for the variable in question given available
data, but the true value may be slightly higher or slightly lower. Because estimates are derived from
data collected from a representative sample of the population, there is a degree of uncertainty. The
amount of uncertainty depends on multiple factors, the most important of which is the number of
survey respondents who provided the data from which any given estimate is derived. The
uncertainty is quantified as a set of values that range from a value slightly less than the reported
estimate to a value a similar percentage above it. By convention, this range, known as a confidence
interval, is calculated to reflect 95 certainty that the true value for the population falls within the
defined range. (See Appendix A for details about the magnitude of confidence intervals around
estimates in this study.)
When size estimates of subpopulations (e.g., synagogue members, intermarried families, families
with children, etc.) are provided, they are calculated as the weighted number of households or
individuals for which the respondents provided sufficient information to classify them as members
of the subgroup. When data are missing, those respondents are counted as if they are not members
of the subgroups for purposes of estimation. Accordingly, all subpopulation estimates may
undercount information on those least likely to complete the survey or answer particular questions.
Missing information cannot be imputed reliably in many such cases because the information that
could serve as the basis for imputation is also missing. Refer to the codebook (Appendix D) for the
actual number of responses to each question.
Some tables and figures that present proportions do not add up to 100. In most cases, this is a
function of rounding, with proportional estimates rounded to the nearest whole number. In some
cases, however, this is a result of respondents having the opportunity to select more than one
response to a question. In such cases, the text of the report will indicate that multiple responses
were possible. When a table shows 0, it means no respondents selected that option, 1
indicates that the estimate rounded down to 0, and  indicates that there were insufficient
responses to report reliable estimates.
For simplicity, not all groups will be displayed in all tables. For example, if the proportion of
respondents who made a donation to a Jewish organization is shown, the proportion who did not
donate will not be displayed.
9  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Reporting Qualitative Data
The survey included several questions that called for openended responses. These were used to
elicit more information about respondents opinions and experiences than could be provided in the
multiple choice or checkbox formats typical of survey questions. All such responses were
categorized, or coded, to identify topics and themes mentioned by multiple respondents. Because
a consistent set of response options were not offered to respondents, it would be misleading to
report weighted estimates of responses to these questions. Instead, we report the total number of
respondents whose answers fit a particular code or theme. This number appears in parentheses
after the response, without a percentage sign, or in tables labeled as n or number of responses. In
most cases, sample quotes are also provided, edited for clarity and with identifying information
removed.
Comparisons Across Surveys
As part of the goal to assess trends, comparisons of answers to a number of questions are made to
earlier local data (in particular, the 2002 study) and data from national studies (in particular, Pews
2013 A Portrait of Jewish Americans). Although these analyses are informative, comparisons across
studies are not as precise and reliable as the data from the present study. Exact comparisons are not
possible for several reasons. The most important of these, noted above, is that the methods used to
develop sample frames in the present study differ from those used in 2002.
Report Overview
This report begins with a portrait of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community as a whole and
continues with more indepth looks at topics of relevance to community members and leaders.
Chapter 2. Demographic Snapshot
This chapter provides an overview of the composition of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish
community: its size, demographic characteristics, and geographic distribution.
Chapter 3. Patterns of Jewish Engagement
This chapter describes the multifaceted ways in which the Jews of Greater Pittsburgh define and
express their Jewish identities. It uses a set of behavioral measures to characterize Jewish
engagement based on participation in Jewish life, both communally and individually. This
characterization yields a typology of five patterns of engagement that will be used throughout the
report to understand the behaviors and attitudes of members of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish
community.

11  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Knowledge of the size, geographic distribution, and basic sociodemographic characteristics of the
Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community provides context for understanding the character, behavior,
and attitudes of community members. Pittsburgh Jewry is not homogenous. The ways in which
Pittsburgh Jews identify as Jewish and engage with the Jewish community vary significantly in
terms of who they are, where they live, their household composition, their ages, and their Jewish
identities. This demographic overview describes the size of the community and the basic
characteristics of community members.
Jewish Population Estimate
The 2017 community study estimates that the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, as defined by
the borders of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburghs catchment area,8 numbers about
49,200 Jewish adults and children. Pittsburghs Jews constitute just over 2 of the area
population.9 From 2002 to 2017, Pittsburghs
Jewish population grew by about 17. The
overall regional population grew 2 from 2005
to 2016, but the population of Allegheny
County, where the vast majority of the Jewish
community lives, declined by 2. It is often
more appropriate, however, to compare the
Jewish community to the nonHispanic white
collegeeducated population, which increased by
29 from 2005 to 2016 across both the full five
county area and Allegheny County alone.
The findings of previous studies of the Jewish
community of Greater Pittsburgh indicate that
the size of the community has been relatively
stable, with a slight overall decline over the past 80 years. The 1938 study,10 the earliest existing
written report, estimated that there were 54,000 Jewish individuals in Pittsburgh. Between 1938 and
1963, the Jewish population declined to 45,000.11 The 1984 study12 estimated the local Jewish
population at 44,906 individuals, essentially the same as in 1963. Finally, the 2002 study13 estimated
the Jewish population at 42,200 individuals.
Jewish Adults
Estimates of the size of the Jewish population rest on a set of fundamental questions about who is
counted as Jewish for the purposes of the study. Recent studies, such as Pew Research Centers
2013 A Portrait of Jewish Americans, classify respondents according to their responses to a series of
screening questions: What is your religion? Do you consider yourself to be Jewish aside from
religion? Were either of your parents Jewish? Were you raised Jewish? Based on the answers to
these questions, Jews have been categorized as Jews by religion (JBR)if they respond to a

question about religion by stating that they are solely Jewishand Jews of no religion (JNR)if
their religion is not Judaism, but they consider themselves Jewish in some other way. Jews by
religion tend to be more engaged with Judaism than Jews of no religion, but many JBRs and JNRs
look similar in terms of Jewish behaviors and attitudes. For the purposes of this study, and to
ensure that Pittsburgh Jewry could be compared to the population nationwide, a variant of Pews
scheme was employed, supplemented by several other measures of identity. Included in the Jewish
population are those adults who indicate they are Jewish and another religion; we refer to this
category as Jews of multiple religions (JMR).
Among Jewish adults in the Greater Pittsburgh area, 82 (35,100 individuals) identify as Jewish by
religion (JBR). This proportion is higher than that of the overall United States Jewish population as
reported by Pew (78).14 The remaining Jewish adults (18) identify as Jews of no religion (JNR)
or Jews of multiple religions (JMR). A little more than half of these individuals (4,300) have no
religion but say they consider themselves Jewish for ethnic or cultural reasons. The remainder
(3,400) consider themselves to be Jewish along with another religion.15
Jewish Households
Pittsburghs Jewish population resides in an estimated 26,800 households. Households are
classified as Jewish if they include at least one Jewish adult (Table 2.1).
Adults and children who live in Jewish households include Jews and nonJews (Table 2.2). Non
Jewish adults include three groups: those who report that they are not Jewish in any way (listed as
not Jewish); those who say they are Jewish but were not born to Jewish parents, were not raised
Jewish, and did not convert (listed as Jewish affinity); those who have Jewish parents or were raised
Jewish but do not currently consider themselves to be Jewish in any way (listed as Jewish
background). NonJewish children include those who are being raised with no religion or a religion
other than Judaism. Of the nonJewish children, nearly all are being raised with no religion or their
parents have not yet decided on their religion.
Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh include an estimated 7,800 nonJewish adults and 2,000
nonJewish children. These 9,800 individuals bring the total population of people living in Jewish
households in the region to approximately 59,000 people (50,600 adults and 8,400 children).

In addition to the adults listed here, the study found fewer than 500 adults who have a Jewish
background but do not consider themselves Jewish in any way and do not live with any other
Jewish adults. These individuals are not included in Table 2.2. The study also found fewer than
400 adults of Jewish affinity who live outside of Jewish households in the Pittsburgh area. These
individuals are not included in Table 2.2.

Age and Gender Composition
The Pittsburgh Jewish community is slightly older than
the US Jewish community as a whole. The mean age of
Pittsburghs Jewish adults based on the present
population estimate is 51 and the median is 54, older
than the median age of Jewish adults nationally, 50.16 The
mean age of all Pittsburgh Jews is 45 and the median is
50. Compared to the national Jewish population, the
Pittsburgh Jewish community has more seniors and
fewer adults under age 50 (Table 2.3).
The agegender pyramid (Figure 2.1) shows the
distribution of the population. The largest shares of the adult Jewish population are between ages
1829 and 6069. There are notably fewer Jews in their 30s and 40s.
Two indicators suggest that the community may be getting younger. Younger adults, ages 1829,
constitute nearly onefifth (18) of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish population. Thirtyeight percent
of these young adults are married, cohabiting, or engaged, but only 1 have children. Additionally,
nearly 40 of children being raised Jewish in some way in the community are ages 05 (see
Chapter 4). Taken together, these developments signal that the community may expect to see
continued growth.
Overall, the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community has more females than males (53 and 47,
respectively), with 1 of adults identifying as a gender other than male or female.

Household Composition
Households with children under age 18 (comprising singleparent, twoparent, or multigenerational
households) make up 18 of Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh (Figure 2.2). The remaining
households consist of single adults (28), couples without children (31), and households with
parents and adult children living together (multigenerational households; 14). Among households
in which a single adult resides, 33 are seniors ages 65 and older, 41 are 5064, and the
remaining 26 are 1849 years of age.
Overall, about threefifths of households (61) include a married, engaged, or cohabiting couple,
living with or without children or other relatives. This rate has decreased from 2002, when it was
66. Eighteen percent of households today include children, compared to 30 in 2002. Among
households with children, the mean number of children ages 17 and younger is 1.7. The mean size
of all households is 2.2 individuals.
Jewish Identity by Age
Jewish identity can vary by age, with the number and
proportion of Jews of no religion (JNR) or Jews of
multiple religions (JMR) tending to be greatest in the
millennial generation.19 As displayed in Table 2.4,
however, that is not the case in Greater Pittsburgh.
Jews younger than 35 and those ages 65 and older
have larger shares of JBRs.

Jewish Denominations
Historically, denominational
affiliation has been one of the basic
indicators of Jewish identity and
practice. Overall, twothirds of
Pittsburghs Jewish adults identify
with a formal Jewish denomination,
and the remainder indicate they are
secular, just Jewish, or have no
specific denomination (Table 2.5).
The largest denomination, Reform,
includes onethird of Jewish adults.
The proportion of Pittsburgh
Jews who identify as Reform or
Conservative has declined since
2002 (Table 2.6). Fourteen years
ago, these two groups accounted
for nearly threequarters (73)
of Pittsburgh Jews. Today, they
are 56. By contrast, those who
claim no denominationthat is,
those who are secular, culturally
Jewish, just Jewish, or have no
specific denominationhave
increased from 17 to 30 of
the population. Notably, there has also been an increase in the Orthodox population, from 7 to
9. Pittsburgh Jews are equally likely as US Jews overall to claim a denominational affiliation.
Inmarriage and Intermarriage
Sixtyone percent of Jewish
households include a couple
who is married or partnered.
Of those couples, 56 are
inmarried and 44 are
intermarried. Ten percent of
inmarried couples
include someone who
converted to Judaism.
Regarding individual Jewish
adults, nearly twothirds
(65) are married or
partnered (Table 2.7).

Among them, 71 are inmarried and 29 are intermarried. Those in the youngest age group, ages
1834, are least likely to be married or partnered (48), but of those who are, 60 have a Jewish
spousepartner. The proportion of households that include a married couple, as well as the
intermarriage rate, are similar to what was found in 2002.20
Jewish Young Adults
Young adults, ages 18 to 44, constitute 37 of Pittsburghs adult Jewish population. Nearly one
quarter are students, with 18 attending school fulltime and 5 attending parttime. The majority
(68) of students are undergraduates, with the rest in graduate or professional programs. Twoin
three (64) young adult Jews identify with a specific denomination. Eleven percent are Orthodox,
22 are Conservative, and 26 are Reform. Overall, 61 of Jewish young adults are married or
living with a partner or significant other. Of these, 54 are married to or living with someone who
is Jewish. Among the 39 of Jewish young adults who are not married or living with a partner or
significant other, 8 are currently dating. There are not enough data to know how many of these
young adults are dating Jews.
Other Groups
Multiple stakeholders in the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community expressed interest in other
groups of Jews living in the area, including Israelis, LGBTQ Jews, and Jews of color. Too few
respondents were interviewed to be able to estimate characteristics of these groups. Only the sizes
of these groups could be estimated with any reliability. Three percent of the adult Jewish
population are Israeli, and 3 are LGBTQ. One percent are Jews of color or of Hispanic or Latino
origin.21 Eleven percent of Jewish households include someone who identifies as Sephardic or
Mizrachi.
Geographic Distribution
The Jews of Greater Pittsburgh can be divided among five regions: Squirrel Hill (the most
concentrated Jewish neighborhood), the rest of the city of Pittsburgh, the South Hills, the North
Hills, and the surrounding suburbs. The distribution of Jews in Greater Pittsburgh is described in
Table 2.8. The community continues to grow in its traditional enclave of Squirrel Hill, but since
2002, a greater share of newcomers has chosen to live in other areas within the region. Maps
showing the distribution of Jewish households appear below (Figures 2.3 and 2.4).
About half (55) of Jewish adults ages 5064 live outside the city of Pittsburgh (Table 2.9). About
twothirds of each other age group live in the city. Nearly half (48) of Jewish children are being
raised in Squirrel Hill.

Reasons for Moving to Pittsburgh
Respondents who moved to the Pittsburgh area in the last five years were asked why they moved
to the area. Overall, 186 respondents provided answers, which were coded thematically. The most
commonly cited reasons were for a job (72), to study in a particular college or university (55), or to
be closer to family (32).
Plans to Move Away
Of all Jewish adults, 18 have plans to move out of the Pittsburgh area in the next three years,
though nearly onethird of these are current students. Overall, 181 respondents provided at least
one reason why they planned to move. Fortyone of these respondents are currently students, who
expect to graduate and move away to pursue further educational opportunities or begin their
careers. Among all respondents, the most frequently cited reasons for moving away were for a job
(50), for family reasons (31), to study (27), to retire (14), or for the opportunity to live somewhere
with better weather (12).

21  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The diversity of Greater Pittsburgh Jewry is reflected not only by the varied demographics of the
residents, but in the many types of Jewish identification and means of engagement in Jewish life.
Examining the ways in which Pittsburgharea Jews not only view, but also enact their Jewish
identities, is necessary to understand this population and the ways in which Jewish life in the region
can be enhanced.
Background: Classifications of Jewish identity
As discussed in Chapter 2, many Jewish demographic studies, including most recently Pew (2013),
classify Jewish adults as either Jewish by religion (JBR; they respond that they are Jewish when
asked about their religious identity) or Jews of no religion (JNR; they consider themselves to be
Jewish in a way other than religion). For purposes of this report and comparability with other
studies, we used a variant of this set of classifications for the population estimates.
Although research has shown that Jewish adults who are JBR are, overall, more engaged Jewishly
than those who are JNR, these classifications are too broad to provide insight about the range of
Jewish behaviors and attitudes within each group. We developed a new set of categories specifically
for this study that are based on behavior rather than selfidentification. We refer to these categories
as the Index of Jewish Engagement.
Index of Jewish Engagement
We specifically designed the Index of Jewish Engagement to identify opportunities for increased
engagement for groups with different needs and interests. The Index focuses on the ways in which
individuals occupy and involve themselves in Jewish life. Such behaviors are concrete and
measurable expressions of Jewish identity. In many cases, behaviors are correlated with
demographic characteristics, background, and attitudes. Jewish adults decisions to take part in
activities may reflect the value and meaning they find in these activities, the priority they place on
them, the level of skills and resources that enable them to participate, and the opportunities
available and known to them. We are interested in how Pittsburgharea Jews think about their
Jewish identities and participate in Jewish life.
To develop the Index, we selected a range of Jewish behaviors that were included in the survey
instrument. The set of Jewish behaviors used to develop the typology are inclusive of the different
wayspublic and privatethat contemporary Jews engage with Jewish life. Cultural activities, such
as participation in educational programs, reading Jewish literature, and using Jewish sources on the
web are included in addition to religious activities, such as attendance at religious services and
observance of Jewish laws of Shabbat and kashrut. Some of the activities are located primarily
within institutions (e.g., synagogue membership), while others are homebased (e.g., Passover
seders). These behaviors are classified into four dimensions of Jewish life: family and homebased
Chapter 3. Patterns of Jewish Engagement
22  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
practices, ritual practices, personal activities, and organizational participation. The behavioral
measures include:
Family holiday celebrations: Participating in a Passover seder and lighting Hanukkah
candles. Family holiday celebrations are practiced by many US Jews for religious and other
reasons, e.g., social, familial, cultural, and ethnic. In contrast to High Holy Day services,
these can be practiced at home without institutional affiliation.
Ritual practices: Keeping kosher, lighting Shabbat candles or having a Shabbat dinner,
attending religious services regularly, attending High Holy Day services, fasting on Yom
Kippur.
Personal activities: Engaging in cultural activities (book, music, TV, museum), reading
Jewish material (newsletter, website), following news about Israel.
Communal activities: Belonging to a synagogue, belonging to a JCC or other Jewish
organization, attending Jewish activity, volunteering for Jewish organizations, donating to
Jewish causes.
We employed a statistical tool, latent class analysis (LCA),23 to cluster similar patterns of behavior
based on respondents answers to survey questions. LCA identifies groups of behaviors that
cluster together by analyzing patterns of responses. The result of the LCA analysis was the
identification of five unique patterns of Jewish engagement.
Patterns of Jewish Engagement
Within the set of behaviors listed above, Jewish individuals make unique choices regarding their
participation in Jewish private and communal life. Nonetheless, individual sets of choices can be
clustered into patterns of behavior that are similar to one another. Applying LCA to the data from
the survey responses yielded five distinct patterns of behavior and engagement with Jewish life in
Greater Pittsburgh. The patterns are summarized in Figure 3.1 and described below. Table 3.1
shows, for each pattern, the level of participation in each of the 15 behaviors that were used to
construct the Index of Jewish Engagement.
Using LCA, each Jewish adult in the community was classified into one of the five engagement
groups according to the pattern that most closely matches the individuals participation in different
types of Jewish behaviors. The classification enables us to understand the characteristics of people
who participate in Jewish life in different ways: the demographics, background, and attitudes that
are associated with each pattern of participation. For purposes of this report, the names of the
engagement groups will be used to refer to the groups of Jewish adults who most closely adhere to
each pattern. The names of the groups were developed specifically for this study and are intended
to highlight the behaviors that distinguish each group from the others.
The five patterns differ both in degree and types of engagement with a broad set of Jewish
behaviors. Two patterns exhibit engagement with all aspects of Jewish life including holiday, ritual,
personal, and communal behaviors. For Jews with the Immersed pattern, all behaviors are
practiced by large majorities of the group, with the exception of volunteering and cultural activities.
Those with the Connected pattern have high participation in many of the activities, though less
23  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
so than the Immersed group. However, the Connected attend Shabbat dinners and services and
observe kashrut much less often than do the Immersed.
Two groups represent medium levels of engagement. In comparing these two groups, the
Involved group has lower levels of Jewish holiday observance and synagogue membership, but a
greater share participate in Jewish personal activities and Jewish organizations aside from
synagogues. In contrast, the Holiday group has higher levels of kashrut observance, Jewish
holiday observance, and synagogue membership, but lower participation in Jewish personal and
communal activities.
The lowest level of engagement is found in the Minimally Involved group, in which only
minorities participate in any of the activities listed, including 2 of the total population who
participate in none of them.
As shown in Figure 3.1, the Connected and Involved patterns describe the largest groups, each
comprising 29 of Jewish adults. The Immersed pattern reflects 16 of the Jewish population.
Each of the other groups accounts for less than oneinseven Pittsburgh Jewish adults. The
remainder of this chapter describes the distinguishing characteristics of each of the five groups.
Figure 3.1 Patterns of Jewish engagement
24  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Jewish Behaviors and Jewish Engagement
As shown in Table 3.1, the Jewish behaviors across the five engagement patterns vary widely, but
all patterns include at least some behaviors that represent a connection to Jewish life. This section
focuses on the 15 behaviors used to construct the typology of Jewish engagement. Later chapters
of this report relate these patterns to specific areas of Jewish communal engagement and attitudes
about Judaism and Jewish life.
Family Holidays
The homebased holidays of Passover and Hanukkah are widely observed. They are almost
universal in the Immersed and Connected groups and widespread in the Involved and Holiday
groups. Only a minority in the Minimally Involved group observe them.

Ritual Activities
Other than kashrut, all ritual practices are observed by almost all of those in the Immersed group.
Observance of the High Holy Days, through synagogue attendance and fasting on Yom Kippur, is
nearly universal among those in the Connected group. Among those in the Involved group, almost
half (46) fast on Yom Kippur, but few (8) attend High Holy Day services. Less than half (42)
of those in the Holiday group attend services on High Holy Days, but a larger share (72) fast on
Yom Kippur. Very few in the Minimally Involved group follow any Jewish rituals.
Personal Activities
Nearly all those from the Immersed group visit Jewish websites and seek news about Israel
regularly, and half participate in cultural activities weekly. The Connected and Involved groups are
similar in their participation in Jewish personal activities, with over 90 visiting Jewish websites
and over threequarters seeking news about Israel regularly. Those in the Holiday group participate
less frequently, with about half visiting Jewish websites (42) and seeking news about Israel (57).
A minority of those in the Minimally Involved group (19) access Jewish news and websites, but
about half (56) do seek out news about Israel monthly.
Communal Activities
Communal activities include memberships and participation in synagogue and organizational life.
Nearly all (96) of the Immersed group are synagogue members, as are 67 of the Connected and
22 of the Holiday groups. Few or none of the other groups are synagogue members.
Organization membership, activity, and support through donations is highest among those in the
Immersed group, followed by the Connected and Involved groups.
Demographics and Jewish Engagement
Respondents demographic characteristics and their patterns of engagement are linked. Tables 3.2,
3.3, and 3.4 show the distribution of selected demographic characteristics within the Jewish
engagement categories. To best understand demographic patterns, it is useful to compare the
distribution of each demographic category across the engagement groups to that of the overall
adult Jewish population, shown in the bottom row of each table. This comparison indicates where
each engagement group differs from the overall population. See Appendix B for a table showing
the distribution of engagement groups within each demographic characteristic (i.e., column totals
rather than row totals).
Note that the overall rows in these tables do not necessarily match those given elsewhere in the
report because they are based only on the subset of Jewish adults who provided sufficient
information for assignment of a Jewish engagement category.
There are some age differences across the engagement groups (Table 3.2). The Holiday group has
the largest proportion, 38, of 18to34 year olds and the smallest proportion, 17, of those ages
26  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
65 and over. The Minimally Involved
group includes the smallest
proportion of adults ages 1834, 6,
and fully half of adults ages 5064.
The proportion of Jewish adults who
are married, married to a Jewish
person, and have children varies
across groups (Table 3.3). About
threequarters of the Immersed and
Connected group members are
married, compared to about half of those in the Holiday and Minimally Involved groups. Large
majorities of those in the Connected (86) and Immersed (84) groups are inmarried, compared
to twothirds (67) of the Involved, a little over half of the Holiday (52), and onesixth (16) of
those in the Minimally Involved groups. The Minimally Involved group members have the highest
rate of parents with minor children (25), and the Holiday (15) and Involved (14) groups have
the smallest share of parents.
Within the Immersed, Involved,
and Holiday groups, about one
third (of the adults describe
themselves as prosperous or very
comfortable (Table 3.4). In the
other groups, around half
characterize their standard of
living as prosperous or very
comfortable.

Jewish Background and Jewish Engagement
The following tables describe the Jewish identity and Jewish backgrounds of those in each Jewish
engagement category. Tables 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 show the distribution of selected Jewish identity
characteristics across the Jewish engagement categories (row totals) in comparison to the overall
Jewish adult population (last row). See Appendix B for a table showing the distribution of
engagement groups within each demographic characteristic (i.e., column totals rather than row
totals).
Note that the overall rows in these tables do not necessarily match those given elsewhere in the
report because they are based only on the subset of Jewish adults who provided sufficient
information for assignment of a Jewish engagement category.
Jewish denomination corresponds closely to Jewish engagement but is not identical (Table 3.5).
The Immersed group has the largest share of Orthodox (46), the Holiday group has the largest
share of Conservative (41), and the Connected group has the largest share of Reform Jews
(54). Of the Minimally Involved group, 81 do not identify with any denomination.
All of those in the Immersed group (100)
and the vast majority of those in the
Connected (97) and Holiday (89) groups
are Jewish by religion (JBR; Table 3.6). In
comparison, about threequarters (76) of
those in the Involved group are JBR. The
Minimally Involved group has the largest
proportion (71) who identify as Jews of no
religion (JNR) or Jews of multiple religions
(JMR).

Jewish engagement in adulthood is also
linked to Jewish background. Overall, 74
of Greater Pittsburgh Jewish adults were
raised by two Jewish parents (Table 3.7);
this rate is higher for the Immersed and
Connected groups and lower for the
Minimally Involved group. The majority
of those in the Immersed group (83)
and the Holiday group (63) had some
Jewish education in childhood, as did
slightly more than half of those in the
Connected and Involved groups (57).
Onefifth (21) of those in the Minimally
Involved group had any Jewish education in childhood.
Attitudes about Being Jewish and Jewish Engagement
Just as Jewish behaviors vary across the engagement groups, so too do attitudes about being Jewish
(Figures 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4). The figures below show responses to a set of attitudinal questions that
illustrate the differences among the groups. As is evident from Figure 3.2, over fourinfive (87)
in the Immersed group consider Judaism to be very much part of their daily lives, with the
proportions in the other groups being much less. The same pattern is evident in response to a
question about whether Judaism is a matter of religion and a community (Figure 3.3). Across all
groups, there is general agreement about whether Judaism is an ethnicityan average of 43 of all
groups very much agree. The Minimally Involved are least likely to consider Judaism a matter of

and leading a moral and ethical life are an essential part of being Jewish, there is general agreement
among the Connected, Involved, and Holiday groups on the one hand, and the Immersed and
Minimally Involved group on the other (Figure 3.4).
Those in the Immersed group feel the strongest connections to the community,24 with 61 of
adults feeling very connected to the global Jewish community and 52 to the local Jewish
community (Figure 3.5). An even larger share of the group, 62, consider it very important to be
connected to the local Jewish community. Among the remaining groups, the share who feel
connected to the Jewish community is successively smaller but the pattern is similar: a larger share
feel more connected to the global community than the local Jewish community, and more people
believe it is very important to be connected to the local Jewish community than feel they are very
much part of that community.

31  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
In the Greater Pittsburgh area with approximately 6,400 Jewish children, there are 11 Jewish early
childhood centers, three Jewish day schools and yeshivot, and 15 parttime schools.25 The
community is also served by at least 19 summer overnight and day camps.
The focus of this chapter is on the choices that parents make regarding how to raise their children
and how families take advantageor, in some cases, do notof Pittsburghs Jewish educational
opportunities. The goal is to describe the landscape of educational programs, including Jewish
preschools, formal Jewish education programs, both parttime and fulltime; as well as informal
Jewish education programs, including camp and youth groups.
Jewish Children
Raising Jewish children does not start
with educational institutions. Parents
make initial decisions regarding how
to raise their children: Jewish
religiously or culturally, no religion,
multiple religions, or another religion.
Among the 8,400 children who live in
Greater Pittsburgh Jewish
households, there are 6,400 children
being raised Jewish (Table 4.1).
Another 1,600 children are being raised in no religion. Parents have not yet decided how to raise an
additional 200 children. Two hundred children are being raised exclusively in a religion other than
Judaism.
Of all children in Jewish households,
over half (56) are being raised by
inmarried parents, 38 by
intermarried parents, and the
remainder, 6, by single parents.
Among Jewish children, three
quarters (73) have inmarried
parents, 22 have intermarried
parents, and 4 have single parents.
Over half (56) of children in Jewish
homes are being raised Jewish by
religion (Table 4.2). Another 15 are
being raised as secular or cultural Jews. Five percent of children are being raised Jewish and another
religion, 19 have no religion, and 2 are being raised in a different religion.

Religion of Children by Household Characteristics
Overall, 76 of children in Jewish households are being raised Jewish in some way (Table 4.3).
Nearly all parents who are part of the Immersed, Connected, and Holiday engagement groups are
raising their children Jewish in some way, as are the majority (73) of parents in the Involved
group. No children with parents who are part of the Minimally Involved group are being raised
Jewish in any way.26 Nearly all children in
Jewish households in Squirrel Hill (90)
and the South Hills (88) are being raised
Jewish, compared with just over half of
children (54) in the rest of the City of
Pittsburgh and twothirds (67) in the
North Hills.
Nearly all children of inmarried parents are
being raised exclusively Jewish, with 86
being raised Jewish by religion and 13
raised as secular or cultural Jews (Figure
4.1). Among children of intermarried
parents, onethird (33) are being raised
exclusively Jewish, and another 11 are
being raised Jewish and another religion
(Figure 4.2). Only six percent are being
raised in another religion, but half of
children of intermarried parents are being
raised with no religion or with no decision
yet made.
These rates have remained steady since
2002, but because there are fewer children
overall today than there were in 2002, the
number of children in each category is
smaller. Nevertheless, these findings
suggest both a challenge and an
opportunity for the Greater Pittsburgh
Jewish community. Very few interfaith
families who are not explicitly raising their
children as Jews have enrolled them in any
sort of Jewish educational program. As the
Pew study and other research show,27
children of intermarried parents are much
more likely to grow up identifying as
Jewish if they are exposed to highquality
Jewish educational experiences as children.
By contrast, even if parents intend to raise

their children as Jews, those children who do not participate in Jewish educational programs tend
to have significantly weaker ties to the Jewish community when they become adults. Should these
children seek to explore their Jewish heritage in the future, their ability to find Jewish programs that
match their interests and feel comfortable will be the two most important factors in determining
whether they identify as Jews in adulthood.

Participation in Jewish Education
Jewish education is provided in the context of Jewish preschools; formal classroom settings, such
as day school and parttime supplementary school; and informal settings, including camp, youth
groups, and peer trips to Israel. Overall, nearly onehalf (45) of Jewish children28 are enrolled in
some form of formal Jewish education. Table 4.4 shows the overall numbers of children in each
form of Jewish education. This table also displays the proportion of Jewish children who are
enrolled in each form of Jewish education, among Jewish children who are ageeligible to attend
that form of Jewish education.
Of Jewish children who are not yet in kindergarten, 28 are currently enrolled in a Jewish
preschool program (Table 4.4). Formal Jewish education includes parttime and fulltime school
programs, as well as private tutoring and classes. Almost onequarter (24) of Jewish children in
grades K12 are enrolled in parttime schools, including 31 of those in grades K8 and 15 of
those in grades 912. For fulltime day schools, 19 of K12 students are enrolled, including 21
of K8 Jewish students and 8 of Jewish high school students.
In addition to enrollment in Jewish educational institutions, 11 of children participate in some
other form of Jewish learning, such as bar or bat mitzvah tutoring, Hebrew or Yiddish language
lessons, or Rosh Chodesh clubs.

Informal Jewish education refers to camps and youth groups. Twentynine percent of Jewish
children in grades K12 attended Jewish day camp in summer 2017, and 16 attended an overnight
Jewish camp. Thirtyseven percent of all Jewish children in grades K12 attended at least one camp.
Onefifth of Jewish children in grades 612 participated in a Jewish youth group during the 201617
school year. Fifteen percent of Jewish high school students have traveled to Israel on a peer trip.
More than half (52) of Jewish children in grades K12 participated in some form of Jewish
education during the 201617 school year.
Drivers of Participation in Jewish Education
Because decisions to participate in Jewish education are typically made by parents, those outcomes
are linked with the characteristics and overall engagement of adults. Tables 4.5 and 4.6 describe the
households who participate in various forms of Jewish education. In these two tables, for each
household characteristic listed, the table shows the proportion of Jewish households with Jewish
ageeligible children who have at least one child enrolled in that form of Jewish education.

Formal Jewish Education: Preschool, Parttime school, Day school
Families in the Immersed group participate in formal Jewish education at higher rates than other
groups.
Onefifth (19) of intermarried households with Jewish children in grades K12 have at least one
child in parttime school, in contrast to 29 and 32 of inmarried and unmarried households.
Households with higher selfdescribed standards of living are just as likely as less affluent families
to send their children to Jewish preschools and parttime schools, but less likely to send their
children to Jewish day schools. About half of households with ageeligible children in the South
Hills (55) and Squirrel Hill (46) send their children to a Jewish early childhood program,
compared to about onethird in the rest of the city of Pittsburgh (37) and the North Hills (30).
Respondents with children not enrolled in a Jewish early childhood program were asked about the
motivating factors behind their choices. No one reason was critical for a majority of parents. More
than half (57) said they were not interested. Onetenth cited cost and 16 concerns over location
or transportation. Seven percent said they could not find a good fit for their child. Onesixth (16)
cited some other reason, including convenience, alternative care plans, a perception of the superior
quality of secular programs, or an explicit desire to have children cared for in secular settings.
Informal Jewish Education: Camps and Youth Groups
For most forms of informal education, participation follows expected patterns of engagement
(Table 4.6). Participation is highest among families in the Immersed group. However, Israel travel
is an exception: households in the Connected group with teenagers are about equally likely to have
sent a child on a youth trip to Israel.
Participation in camp, youth group, and Israel travel is higher for inmarried than intermarried
families. Israel trips and youth groups are the most common informal education activities for
intermarried families with Jewish schoolage children. Families who are financially prosperous are
equally likely to participate in overnight Jewish camp as other families. They are, however, less
likely to have sent children to highschool Israel group trips.
Parents who did not send their child to a Jewish camp primarily cite a preference for other
activities (56) or a lack of interest (45). Cost is less widely regarded as an important reason to
reject Jewish camp (26). Only 1 cited a lack of an ageappropriate option, while 20 claimed
some other reason, including a preference for other summer camps, conflict with family vacations,
and the lack of good options for specialneeds children. Additionally, several families whose
children are enrolled in formal educational programs during the year chose to give their children a
break from yearround Jewish educational programming.

39  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Religious and ritual observance constitute one way Pittsburgh Jews express their Jewish identities.
Synagogues have long been the central communal and religious home for American Jews, and
membership in a congregation is one of the key ways Jews affiliate with the Jewish community.
Synagogue membership notwithstanding, many Jews participate in rituals on a daily or intermittent
basis at home. Some Jews perform rituals for religious reasons, while other Jews are motivated by
civic, familial, and cultural reasons.
Synagogues and Congregations
In the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, 35 of households (approximately 9,400) belong to a
synagogue or another Jewish worship community of some type (Table 5.1). Thirtyeight percent of
Jewish adults live in synagoguemember households, comparable to that of the rest of the country
(39) but lower than rates found in 2002 (53).
Synagogue affiliation models appear to be changing. In many cities, even as overall synagogue
membership rates are declining, alternatives to brickandmortar synagogues such as independent
minyanim have grown in popularity, and voluntary contributions have replaced dues in some
congregations.31 For this study, respondents indicated whether they were members of a Jewish
congregation, such as a synagogue, temple, minyan, chavurah, or High Holy Day congregation.
Members were asked to name each congregation (up to five) and, for each one, to indicate whether
they pay dues, consider themselves members without paying dues, or dues are not required for
membership. Using this information, all congregations that could be identified were coded with a
type and denomination. Onefifth of
Jewish households (19) indicate
that they are duespaying members of
a brickandmortar synagogue (Table
5.1a).
Synagogue membership is nearly
universal among those in the
Immersed group (94), and nearly
twothirds (63) of those in the
Connected group and about onefifth
(21) of the Holiday group are
synagogue members. Very few in the
Involved or Minimally Involved
groups have joined a congregation.
Rates of congregational membership
are similar across all regions.
Those who have lived in the
community for less than 10 years are

the most likely to be members of any congregation (39; Table 5.1b) but the least likely to pay
dues to a brickandmortar synagogue (6). Pittsburghs longestterm Jewish residents are less
likely to be members of a congregation (30); most who are members belong to congregations
with traditional building or membership structures. About half (54) of inmarried households are
synagogue members of any type, compared to about threetenths (30) of intermarried
households. Although adults ages 1834 are as likely as those 65 and older to belong to any type of
congregation, very few of the former group pay dues to a brickandmortar synagogue. As might be
expected, nearly all (90) Orthodox Jews are members of a congregation of some sort. Nearly half
of Pittsburghs Orthodox Jewish population are duespaying members of brickandmortar
synagogues. However, a higher proportion than otherwise might be expected are members of
congregations that do not require dues for membership. The strong presence of Chabad
throughout the Greater Pittsburgh area partially explains this finding.

Among synagogue member
households, 76 are duespaying
members of brickandmortar
synagogues, and 12 indicate that
they are members of synagogues but
do not pay duesincluding those
congregations where dues are not
required (Table 5.2). Overall, 15
of synagogue member households
belong to an alternative
congregational structure, including a
minyan or chavurah (8 of member
households; 3 of all households)
and Chabad (7 of member
households; 3 of all households). Five percent of member households belong to synagogues that
are out of the region, and 22 belong to congregations that could not be identified from the
responses. Eleven percent of member households belong to multiple synagogues or worship
groups. In all, 2 of member households belong to both a brickandmortar synagogue and an
alternative.
Among households who are
members of brickandmortar
synagogues, nearly all (93)33 are
members of Orthodox (20),
Conservative (24) or Reform
(52) congregations (Table 5.3).
Eight percent are members of
synagogues with other
denominations (e.g., Renewal or
Reconstructionist) or no
denomination.
Of households that do not currently belong to a synagogue, 40 (or 26 of all households)
formerly did so. Respondents who indicated that no one in their households were members of
Jewish congregations were asked to identify the reasons why they were not members. About half
(45) of these respondents indicated that they did not join because they were not religious, one
quarter cited the cost of membership, and onequarter indicated membership was not a priority.
Seventeen percent had not joined because of the lack of a good fit for them, and 12 said they
were not members because they had no children at home.
Respondents were also given the opportunity to cite other reasons for not joining a synagogue, and
120 did so. Of these, the most common reasons cited were not liking the rabbi or the leadership of

respondents cited other reasons such as not going often enough or political disagreement with
members or congregational leaders, and others indicated plans to join in the future.

Several respondents elaborated on their reasons for not joining a synagogue. One wrote, They
never seemed interested in childless adults. Another said he or she has donated to and attended
High Holy Day services at a local congregation for decades but did not join. One respondent felt
there was too much pressure to volunteer: Chairing a committee and participating on others didnt
seem enough for some reason.
Synagogue Participation
Both members and nonmembers of synagogues participate to varying degrees in synagogue life,
including attending religious services or other synagoguebased programs, volunteering, or
donating (Tables 5.4a and 5.4b). Over threequarters (79) of Jewish adults attended at least one
religious service in the past year, with attendance nearly universal among those who are part of the
Immersed and Connected groups. Almost onequarter of adult Jews (24) attended monthly or
more, and 52 attended High Holiday services. Nearly all (89) of those in the Immersed group
and threefifths (60) of those in the Connected group say they very much felt comfortable the
last time they attended services, compared to, on average, onethird of respondents in the other
engagement groups. Notably, the Immersed group is the only engagement group in which a
majority say their spiritual needs were very much met the last time they attended services, as well
as the only group in which a minority say they felt at all disconnected from the people in the
congregation. The only substantial difference by region is that those who live in Squirrel Hill are
most likely to report they attended services monthly or more, and South Hills residents are far less
likely to have attended High Holy Day services.

Newcomers to the community attended services more frequently than more established residents
and were most likely to say they very much felt comfortable and that their spiritual needs were
met the last time they attended services (Table 5.4b). Young adults were also among the most
frequent attendees and among the most content in their experience at services.
Ritual Practices
The majority of Pittsburghs Jewish adults mark Jewish holidays over the course of the year, with
79 lighting Chanukah candles and 76 attending a Passover seder (Tables 5.5a and 5.5b).
Chanukah celebrations are nearly universal among the Immersed, Connected, and Holiday
engagement groups but less frequent among members of the Involved and Minimally Involved
groups. By contrast, Shabbat candlelighting is widespread among those in the Immersed group but
is less frequent for all other groups. Notably, residents of South Hills were less likely to participate
in most of the rituals assessed in this study than residents of other areas.

Compared to 2002, similar proportions of Jews in the community usually or always light Shabbat
candles and keep kosher, and a smaller proportion attend religious services monthly or more (Table
5.6). Compared to US Jews as a whole, Pittsburgharea Jews are more likely to attend Passover
seders but attend services slightly less frequently. They light Shabbat candles at about the same
rates as the national Jewish community.

47  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community offers diverse avenues for communal participation.
Pittsburgharea Jews join local, regional, and national membership organizations and attend an
array of cultural, educational, and religious events. They volunteer and donate their time to Jewish
and nonJewish causes. Through their participation, they make Jewish friends and strengthen their
ties to the local community. This chapter describes the multiple ways in which Pittsburgharea Jews
interact and participate with their local peers and institutions and points to measures that can
enhance these connections.
Organizations and Activities
Pittsburgharea Jews participate in a wide range of Jewish organizations and activities. Threeinten
households say they currently belong to a Jewish Community Center (JCC) (twointen pay dues),
and nearly onethird (32) of households belong to at least one Jewish organization other than a
synagogue or JCC, such as Hadassah or AIPAC (Table 6.1a). Overall, onefifth (21) of Jewish
households pay dues to a Jewish organization aside from a synagogue or the JCC.

Those in the Connected group are most likely to be members of an organization. Residents of
Squirrel Hill and the South Hills are most likely to be members of the JCC, followed by residents of
the rest of the city of Pittsburgh. A little over onefifth of residents who have resided in Greater
Pittsburgh for at least 10 years pay dues to a Jewish organization other than a synagogue or JCC,
compared to about oneinten residents who have been in the area fewer than ten years (Table
6.1b). Older adults ages 65 and older are most likely to pay membership dues to a Jewish
organization.

Families with children are more likely to be members of the JCC than households without children,
but less likely to be members of other Jewish organizations. Community members between the
ages of 50 and 64 are less likely than other age groups to belong to the JCC.
Nearly half (45) of Jews in Greater Pittsburgh attended a program or event within the past year,
with 11 doing so at least monthly, and 34 doing so less than monthly (Table 6.2a). Seveninten
(68) read a Jewish organizations materials in the past year, with 36 doing so at least monthly,
and 32 doing so less than monthly. Those in the Immersed and Connected groups are most likely
to pay dues, attend programs, and read organizations materials. The Involved group is
distinguished from the remaining engagement groups by the moderate level of participation in the
community across these items.
Residents of Squirrel Hill attend Jewish programs more frequently than residents of other
neighborhoods, likely because most of the programs are hosted by institutions in the
neighborhood. In turn, because programs are more accessible to residents of Squirrel Hill, it is
likely that they read materials from Jewish organizations more frequently due to their connections
with those organizations.

Sources of Information
More than half of the community say
they learn about Jewish events and
programs online (56), from family
or friends (51), or from synagogue
or organizational newsletters (44)
(Table 6.3). Onethird (32) say they
hear about events and programs from
the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle or
another Jewish periodical, and one
fifth (20) receive community news
directly from a rabbi or another Jewish communal professional.
Travel to Jewish Programs
More than eightoutoften Jewish adults (83) say they would be willing to travel on a regular
basis to attend a Jewishsponsored program or event. Among those who would do so, 11 would
go farther than 40 minutes away, nearly half (45) would go farther than 20 minutes away, and
90 would go farther than 10 minutes away (Table 6.4). Those living in Squirrel Hill and the city
of Pittsburgh are less willing to travel as long as those living farther out in the suburbs.

Volunteering
In the Pittsburgh Jewish community, 39 of Jewish adults say they did some volunteer activity in
the past month (Table 6.5a). Nearly onefifth (18) of the overall population volunteered with at
least one Jewish organization, and 28 volunteered with a nonJewish organization. These include
8 who volunteered for both (not shown in table). Fifteen percent of Jewish adults volunteered in
a leadership position in a Jewish organization. Those in the Immersed and Connected groups were
most likely to volunteer under Jewish auspices, while about onethird of Immersed, Connected,
and Involved volunteered for nonJewish groups.

Although there are no significant differences in Jewish volunteering by duration of residence in the
Pittsburgh area, those who have lived in the area for less time tend be more active volunteers with
nonJewish organizations (Table 6.5b). By contrast, although residents ages 3549 or 5064 are most
likely to report volunteering for leadership roles in Jewish organizations, the 35 to 49yearolds are
the least likely group to volunteer at all for nonJewish organizations. Conservative Jews report the
highest overall levels of taking leadership roles in Jewish organizations, while Orthodox Jews report
the lowest rates of volunteering for nonJewish organizations.
54  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Overall, Pittsburgharea Jews believe it is important to be involved with organizations supporting a
wide variety of causes (Tables 6.6a and 6.6b). Education is very important to 83 of the
community, and all engagement groups value that cause highly. Nearly as many believe that health
and medicine (79) is very important, as do almost threequarters about social justice and womens
rights. Those in the Immersed group assign greater weight to causes related to Israel than do
individuals from other groups. In every other engagement group, Israel appears to be less
important than every other topic respondents were asked to value.
Unsurprisingly, older residents, who also tend to be those who have lived in the area the longest,
believe healthrelated causes are more important than younger residents. Orthodox and
Conservative Jews believe Israel is more important than adherents to other denominations or no
denomination. The greatest difference between synagogue members and nonmembers, and
between inmarried and intermarried couples, is also on Israel, with synagogue members and
inmarried couples expressing greater interest.

Philanthropy
Within the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, nearly all (93) Jewish adults report making a
charitable contribution in the past year (Table 6.7a). Threequarters (76) of Jewish adults donated
to at least one Jewish organization. Nearly twothirds (63) of Jewish adults donated to a Jewish
organization that serves the Pittsburgh Jewish community. Just over half (55) of the community
gave less than 2,500 to nonprofits, onequarter contributed 2,500 or more, and the remainder
declined to indicate an amount.
Nearly all of those in the Involved and the Immersed groups donated to a nonprofit organization
in the past year, as did majorities of all groups (Table 6.7a). However, although nearly everyone in
the Immersed and Connected groups made donations to Jewish organizations, seveninten in the
Involved group, onethird of the Holiday group, and oneeighth in the Minimally Involved group
did so.

Longterm residents, who are typically older than newcomers, are more likely to make donations
both in general and to Jewish organizations (Table 6.7b). Inmarried couples, synagogue members,

Jewish organizations in general, though the Orthodox are more likely than members of any other

Informal Involvement in the Jewish Community
Community engagement is closely tied to personal connections and friendships among Jews. The
vast majority (94) of Jews in Greater Pittsburgh have at least some connection to other Jews, and
53 say at least half of their closest friends are Jewish (Figure 6.1). Sixtyfive percent of the
Immersed group respondents and 61 of respondents from the Connected group indicate that
half or more of their close friends are Jewish, reflecting their deep engagement in the Jewish
community.

Informal and Cultural Activities
Informal and cultural activities include Jewish activities that are not sponsored by organizations,
such as seeing Jewish theater, reading Jewish books, eating Jewish foods, and discussing Jewish
topics (Tables 6.8a, 6.8b, 6.8c, and 6.8d).
Overall, 86 of Pittsburgh Jews discussed Jewish topics (e.g., culture, religion, Israel, etc.) in the
past month, including all or nearly all in the Immersed, Connected, and the Involved groups.
About twothirds (68) ate Jewish foods. Slightly fewer (65) searched for Jewish content on the
internet in the past month, including nearly all (95) of those in the Immersed group and three
quarters of those in the Connected (72) and Involved (71) groups.

eat Jewish foods, aside from Shabbat and holiday meals?
talk about Jewish topics (such as culture, Israel, religion, etc.)?
look for Jewish information online?
access Jewishfocused culture (such as books, TV, music, or a museum)?
study a Jewish religious text (such as the Torah or Talmud)?
60  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Over threequarters of each age group discussed Jewish topics in the past month, with over half of
Jewish adults ages 50 and older and just under half of those under age 50 having done so at least
weekly. More than threefifths of each age group sought Jewish content on the internet at least
once per month, with twofifths (43) of young adults ages 1834 having done so at least weekly.
Across most of these activities, Orthodox and Conservative Jews participated more frequently than
others.

Half (49) of Pittsburgh Jews report that they accessed Jewishfocused culture, such as books,
music, museums, or TV programs in the past month, including 79 of the Immersed and over half
of the Involved (56) and Connected (51) groups. Residents of Squirrel Hill (62) and the
South Hills (54) are far more likely to access Jewishfocused culture than residents of other
neighborhoods. Onequarter of adults had studied a Jewish text in the past month, including 80
of those in the Immersed group.

Adults ages 1834 are the most avid consumers of Jewishfocused culture, with onequarter (26)
having sought such activities at least once per week. About half (53) of inmarried Jews accessed
Jewishfocused culture monthly, including onefifth (22) who did so weekly; by contrast, about
onethird (32) of intermarried Jews accessed Jewishfocused culture at least once per month,
including 10 who did so weekly. Nearly nineinten (88) Orthodox respondents studied Jewish
texts monthly, including fourfifths (81) who studied weekly or more often.

Antisemitism
There is some concern among Pittsburghs Jewish community about local antisemitism. At the time
of the survey, a wave of over 120 highly publicized bomb threats and a series of vandalism
incidents targeted Jewish institutions throughout the United States. Although the threats were false
and the responsible party was arrested more than a month before the survey launched, the
incidents may have increased respondents sense of concern.
Although 14 of local Jews say they are not at all concerned about antisemitism in the Greater
Pittsburgh area, more than twothirds (70) indicate they have some concern, and 16 note they
are very much concerned. Members of the Connected, Involved, and Holiday groups express
slightly higher levels of concern than members of the Immersed or Minimally Involved groups.
There is no significant difference in the level of concern across neighborhoods.

Older Jews are more concerned about antisemitism than younger Jews, with onethird (33) of
senior citizens and 10 of 18to34yearolds being very much concerned. Similarly, those who
have lived in the area for ten or more years express greater levels of concern than those who
arrived more recently, though this difference is correlated with age.

Sixteen percent of Pittsburgh Jews directly experienced antisemitism within the past year, and 213
respondents described the incidents in question. The most frequent experiences are listed in Table
6.10 along with the number of respondents who cited each experience.
Most respondents describe their incidents as very minor. As an example of the comments, one
respondent wrote:
This is difficult because we live in a suburb where we are a minority. I would not call it antisemitism of the violent
kind, but what one might call microaggressionspeople saying nasty things about voting for liberal causes, presuming
that we have certain practices because we are Jewish, and not accommodating our needs. (Last year the school
scheduled a dance on Yom Kippur and we had to go and explainThey are better now, but really!)
Some of the incidents are menacing:
A person driving a car cut me off and proceeded to call me a dumb Jew while I was walking across a street on my
way to shul. The person then spit in my direction and told me to go back to Squirrel Hill. (I live in [another
neighborhood].)
Several respondents cite tension around politics:
During the last presidential election, a young, immature neighbor placed a Trump sign in our yard with a note on the
back, something like from your friendly neighborhood youth Hitler. I honestly dont think they even knew we were
Jewish but it hurt deeply.
Bernie Sanders was referred to as one of MY people.

A few cite incidents in the workplace:
I am a college professorAntisemitism is considered politically correct by virtually all faculty in [respondents
department].
A colleague told me that as a Jew, I should have to dissociate myself from Israeli military policies and Jewish ethno
chauvinistic racism before I should be allowed in progressive spaces.
A coworker of mine said that a child we were working with looked ugly and Jewish. And then she said another child
would have survived the Holocaust because she has blonde hair.
These incidents are disturbing, but it is important to emphasize that 84 of Jews in Greater
Pittsburgh report that they did not directly experience any antisemitism in the past year, and most
who did experienced relatively minor incidents. The perception of antisemitism in the community
may be worse than the reality. Nevertheless, the community must remain vigilant to ensure that all
of its members feel safe and secure to enjoy a rich life in both the Jewish community and the wider
community around them.
67  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The Pittsburgh Jewish community has strong ties to Israel, grounded in religious, cultural, and
familial connections. For many Jewish adults, Israel is central to their Jewish identity. Travel to
Israel is frequent and friendships with Israelis are common.
Approximately threefifths (59) of Pittsburghs Jews have been to Israel (Table 7.1a, Figure 7.1).
Onequarter (24) of Jewish adults have been to Israel once, and a similar proportion (28) have
visited more than once. Seven percent, including the 3 who are Israeli citizens, have lived in
Israel at some point.
Travel to Israel has increased since 2002, when 44 of Pittsburghs Jews had been to Israel.34
Pittsburghs numbers also represents a substantially higher proportion than among US Jews in
general, of whom, as of 2013, 43 had been to Israel.35
Those in the Immersed group are the most likely to have been to Israel (86), followed by those in
the Connected group (67). Among those in the Minimally Involved group, onesixth (16) have
been to Israel. Threequarters (73) of Squirrel Hills Jewish residents have been to Israel,
including 51 who have visited multiple times or lived there.

Pittsburgh Jews sense of connection to Israel is strongly correlated with the frequency with which
they have visited the country. Of those who have never been to Israel, onethird (31) feel not at
all connected, and 38 feel somewhat or very much connected to Israel. By contrast, only 15 of
those who have visited Israel once and 3 of those who have visited multiple times do not feel at
all connected to Israel. Of onetime visitors, 63 feel somewhat or very connected, as do 86 of
those who have visited Israel multiple times, lived in Israel, or are Israeli.

Aside from travel to Israel, Pittsburgharea Jews connect to Israel through their family and friends
who live there. Over half (53) of Pittsburgharea Jews indicate that they have close family or
friends living in Israel. Engagement with Israel is further facilitated by fluency in the Hebrew
language. Among Jewish adults who are not Israeli, 6 can understand most or all of what they
read in Hebrew and another 33 can understand some Hebrew. Onethird of Pittsburgharea Jews
say they do not know the Hebrew alphabet, compared to 48 of all US Jews.36
Types of Israel Travel
Among those who have traveled to Israel, about onethird (32) have gone with a Jewish
organization on a mission or other sponsored trip, and threeinten (28) have traveled on an
educational or volunteer program (Table 7.2a). Twofifths (40) of those under age 46 who have
traveled to Israel have gone on Birthright Israel trips, representing 9 of the overall adult
population. The Connected group has the highest proportion who have gone on a Birthright trip,
possibly because Jews from the Immersed group were ineligible, having previously visited Israel on
other peergroup educational trips.37

Emotional Connection to Israel
Feelings of connection to Israel are intimately tied not only to Israel travel, but also to Jewish
engagement. The strongest connections to Israel are found among the Immersed group (63 very
much) and the Holiday group (34 very much; Table 7.3). About threequarters (76) of Jewish
residents of the outer suburbs are somewhat or very much connected to Israel, more than in any
other area in Greater Pittsburgh. Contrary to the popular stereotype, adults ages 1834 are among
the most connected to Israel in the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, with twofifths (40)
feeling very connected.

closely, with twofifths (40) and onefifth (21), respectively, following news about Israel daily.
The Immersed group members follow Israel news most closely, with onethird (35) following
news on a daily basis. About onefifth of Jewish residents of Squirrel Hill (21) also follow news
about Israel on a daily basis.
Community Connection to Israel
About onequarter (23) of Jewish adults in Greater Pittsburgh can correctly identify Karmiel
Misgav as the communitys partnership region in Israel. Another 25 are aware of a partnership
region but cannot identify it. Five percent believe there is no partnership region, and almost half
(46) are not sure if there is a partnership region.

75  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community devotes a significant share of its resources toward caring
for families and individuals who have economic, social, and health needs. The relative affluence of
the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, both financially and in terms of human capital, has
meant the organized Jewish community has been able to meet many of these needs.
Nevertheless, it is clear that there are some unmet needs in the community. Aside from the
expenses associated with affiliating with Jewish organizations, providing Jewish education for
children, purchasing kosher food, and other means of engaging in Jewish life, less affluent families
are also more likely to be struggling with basic necessities such as adequate housing and good
health. There are underserved households throughout the community, but particularly among the
Orthodox, families with children, and young adults.
Educational Attainment and Employment
The Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh is highly educated, not only in comparison with the
overall American population, but also in comparison with the US Jewish population as a whole.
Eightyfour percent of Jewish adults in Greater Pittsburgh have earned at least a bachelors degree,
including over half (56) with at least one postgraduate degree (Figure 8.1). Among Jews in the
United States, over half have attained at least a bachelors degree (58), including onequarter
(28) who have graduate degrees (Pew, 2013). In the US population overall, 30 of adults aged 25
and older hold bachelors degrees, including 12 who hold advanced degrees.38

Commensurate with their high levels of education, the Jews of Greater Pittsburgh work in fields
requiring significant training, including medicine and healthcare (13); science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (12); business and finance (12); and education
(12). Substantial proportions also work in the legal system (7) or social services (6).
Over half (54) of Jewish adults in the community are currently full (45) or parttime (9)
employees. An additional quarter of the population (26) is retired. The remaining onefifth are
stayathome parents, unemployed, on temporary leave, or studying for a degree.
Economic WellBeing and Income
For the US Jewish community as a whole, high educational attainment has made the community
collectively much more affluent than Americans overall. In Pittsburgh, however, the Jewish
communitys high rate of college education has made Pittsburghs Jews only slightly more affluent
than the community around them. Among those who responded to the question about income,
oneinthree (33) households have total income of 100,000 per year or greater,39 including 14
whose household income was 200,000 per year or greater (Table 8.1). On the lower end of the
spectrum, 37 indicate their household income was less than 50,000 per year, including 17 with
household incomes less than 25,000 per year. By contrast, data from the US Census Bureau
indicate that only 5 of all households in the fivecounty study area have annual income of
200,000 or greater, and 46 have annual income less than 50,000, including 23 under
25,000.40
The estimates of the proportions of Jewish households in each income bracket have not changed
significantly from 2002. In both studies, similar proportions of Jewish households reported annual
income of 100,000 or above (32 in 2002; 33 in 2017), and similar proportions reported
income below 50,000 (38 in 2002; 37 in 2017). It is difficult to know whether these numbers
are similar because income increases tended to occur within income brackets, or whether they
reflect general stagnation of middle class wages.41 The shifting demographics of the community,
with an increase in young adults since 2002, may also have resulted in a similar overall income
profile today.

The survey also asked respondents to indicate
their selfperceived standard of living (Table 8.2).
Overall, onethird (33) of the community
describes itself as prosperous or living very
comfortably, and nearly half (45) say they are
living reasonably comfortably. But nearly
onequarter (23) say they are just getting
along, nearly poor, or poor, a possible
indication of economic vulnerability.
Of respondents who answered both the income and standard of living questions, all who indicate
that they are nearly poor or poor report household income below 50,000. By contrast, 10
of those who say they are prosperous or very comfortable report household income below
50,000. Of respondents who say they are just getting along, fourfifths (82) report household
income below 50,000 and onesixth (16) say their household income is at least 50,000 but less
than 100,000.
Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh also display relatively high confidence in their ability to
afford their own retirement. Seveninten (72) Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh are
somewhat or very confident in their ability to finance their retirement; the remainder are not very
confident, not at all confident, or not sure.
Although there are small differences in economic wellbeing based on Jewish engagement and
other demographic groups, most are not significant (Tables 8.3a and 8.3b). Those who are part of

the Holiday group are more likely to describe themselves as nearly poor or poor. Geographically,
residents of areas outside of Pittsburgh and the immediate suburbs are most likely to describe
themselves as nearly poor or poor.
Those who have been in the community for fewer than 10 years are the most affluent, with nearly
half (48) reporting sixfigure household incomes, and 86 saying they are at least reasonably
comfortable. Oneinten young adults (10) ages 1834 say they are nearly poor or poor.

Economic Insecurity and Poverty
Although the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community as a whole is comfortably middle class, some
households struggle with significant economic challenges. As one measure of economic need,
respondents indicated whether they received government benefits or skipped necessities in the past
year (Table 8.4). These benefits included Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or
Supplemental Security Income (SSI); energy or utility assistance; SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program), Medicaid, subsidized housing, or day care assistance; or unemployment
benefits. However, it is important to note that some of these benefits are not entirely restricted to
lowincome households (e.g., SSDI, Medicaid); accordingly, receipt of these benefits is only a
possible indicator of financial need, not a definite indicator. Overall, 16 of households receive
some form of public benefit.
Respondents were also asked about life changes that had occurred in the previous year that resulted
in economic hardship. Overall, 14 report encountering such a hardship. Nine percent report a
change in health, such as major illness; 7 report a change in employment, such as a reduction in
pay; 2 report a change in family structure, such as divorce; and 1 report a change in housing,
such as foreclosure.
In addition to the questions
on public benefits, hardships,
and insecurities, 24 of
respondents are not
confident in their ability to
save for retirement, and 4
say they have been
constrained from
participating in Jewish life in
the community due to
financial issues. Seventy
three respondents cite
specific ways that financial
issues have prevented them
from participating in Jewish
communal life. The most
commonly cited challenges
are the high costs of
program or event fees (25
respondents) and synagogue
dues or High Holy Day
tickets (13).
Nearly onefifth (17) of
those in the Immersed and
Holiday groups have received at least one public benefit in the past year. Similar proportions of the
Immersed (14), Connected (17), and Involved (17) groups have experienced economic

hardship in the past year due to changes in their personal or familial circumstances. Over twofifths
(42) of the Minimally Involved say they are not confident in their ability to save for retirement,
and 17 of those in the Holiday group say they cannot afford an emergency 400 expense.
Geographically, residents outside of the city of Pittsburgh and the immediate suburbs are most
likely to be unable to afford an emergency 400 expense. Residents of the North Hills express the
lowest level of potential need as measured by receipt of public benefits.
Rates of receiving public benefits are fairly stable across age groups, though young adults are the
least able to afford emergency expenses. Senior citizens experienced the fewest economic hardships
in the past year, are most confident in their ability to afford retirement, and are best able to afford
emergency expenses. Households with children experienced more hardship and are less able to
afford emergency expenses than households without children.

Health Status and Needs
Understanding the health status of individuals in the community is important because poor health
can be an indicator of needs for communitybased services and may prevent individuals from
participating in the communitys programs.
Overall, almost a quarter (22) of Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh include at least one
person who is in fair or poor health (Tables 8.6a and 8.6b). Onequarter (25) of households
include at least one person who is limited in the amount of work, school, or housework he or she
can do as a result of an impairment, disability, or chronic physical or mental health problem. One
third (38) of households include someone in need of counseling or mental health services. One
third (35) of those in the Involved group say that someone in the household is limited in the kind
or amount of work, school, or housework they can do due to an impairment, disability, or chronic
physical or mental health condition.
Young adults ages 1834 (53) and households with children (40) report the highest rates of
need for mental health services. Senior citizens report the highest rates of impairments or
disabilities (40).
Some members of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community have elderly parents in the area and
are either already providing significant care to them or are planning for the possibility of doing so

in the future. Nine percent indicate that they have a parent living in the area in a household other
than their own who requires elder care services. Four percent have parents living in independent
living facilities, assisted living facilities, or nursing homes in the Greater Pittsburgh area.
Additionally, 2 of households are providing regular caregiving to one or more nonelderly family
members.
Eight percent of households include someone who was constrained by health issues from
participating in the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community in the past year. Of the 120 respondents
who shared details on their specific constraints, the most common obstacles are mobility issues
(54), mental or emotional challenges (22), and chronic illness or disease (21).

84  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
85  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study provides a detailed sociodemographic
portrait of the Pittsburgharea Jewish community and describes community members participation
in Jewish communal life, their private Jewish activities, and their attitudes about Judaism and Israel.
The study was designed to contribute to a better understanding of contemporary Jewish life in
Greater Pittsburgh and to inform policymaking and planning by Jewish communal organizations.
This chapter highlights the ways in which Greater Pittsburghs Jews are engaged with Jewish life
and identifies a number of opportunities to enhance that engagement over the coming years. Some
of the key findings of the study of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community are summarized
below, with a focus on findings that can point the way toward planning for the communitys
future. This chapter also contextualizes the findings by including commentary from some of the
more than 2,000 survey respondents who shared their perceptions of the strengths of the
community, the gaps they perceive in communal services, and their thoughts regarding what the
community could do to make them feel more welcome.
Community Size and Growth
The Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community has grown over the 15 years since its last community
study and now includes 49,200 Jewish individuals living in 26,800 households. However, its
composition has shifted. Today, there are proportionally fewer adults in their 30s and 40s, fewer
families with children, more senior citizens, and more single young adults than there were in 2002.
The community appears to be poised for continued growth in the near future, especially if the
young adults and families who come to Pittsburgh for school or work decide to stay in the area.
The prevalence of young children indicates the potential for growth as those families age, and the
strong regional economy can be expected to attract and retain a skilled workforce in the years
ahead.
The size of the community is seen as an asset to many of its members. Although 120 respondents
mentioned the size of the community as one of its strengths, some considered it to be a large
community, others a small one. One respondent summarized both views:
Small enough that it is not overwhelming, but big enough that there are choices within the community.
The People
According to its members, the greatest strengths of the community lie in its people (528), who they
find to be united (181), welcoming (145), and supportive (107), and actively engaged with
community life (85).
The community is very active and engaged. It is tightknit. Lots of opportunities to get involved and participate if you
look for them.
Chapter 9. Conclusions and Future Directions
86  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
The Jewish community of Pittsburgh is a tightknit, committed group of individuals dedicated to volunteerism,
education, social justice, and providing needed services to children, elderly, and the downtrodden. I am proud to be
part of this community.
By contrast, 35 respondents wrote that a friendlier environment would make them feel more
welcome, and 39 desired more outreach to newcomers and lessaffiliated people.
There is a missing level of outreach to the people who consider themselves Jewish, unaffiliated, and generally younger
and professional. There does not seem to be a whole lot of room for people generally identified as millennial or in the
25 to 40yearold range who have not been raised in the community. It can be difficult to penetrate the established
community if you dont already have some kind of way in.
Being more accepting and welcoming of people who are new to the region and whose families havent lived in the area
for generations.
I think there are some cliques and the personal call or genuine friendlinessnot just to get you to come to the event,
but once you are therego a long way.
Organizations and Leadership
Pittsburghs Jewish community includes many strong institutions. Thirtyfive percent of
households belong to synagogues, 30 say they belong to the JCC, and 24 pay dues to another
Jewish organization. In addition, 76 of adults make donations to at least one Jewish organization.
A total of 326 respondents considered Pittsburghs organizations and leadership to be one of the
sources of the communitys strength. Specifically, 79 mentioned leaders, 72 mentioned the JCC, 68
mentioned synagogues and rabbis, and 48 mentioned the Federation.
There are many organizations and events to choose from, and many people dedicated to them, both professionals and
volunteers.
The JCC is extremely diverse, welcoming, and offers programming that fits my familys lifestyle, especially because it
is multigenerational and emphasizes wellness. I am in that building about three to five days a week and thankful it
exists. I think it is by far the best Jewish organization (in my experience) in Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh has mostly strong synagogues with excellent clergy and loyal communities that work not only within the
Jewish community, but also reach out to other communities as well. We are a small community, and fairly close
together, which makes it easier to communicate.
The Federation is very well run by smart, committed professionals that communicate and work well across all
segments of the Jewish community. The JCC is equally well run and an important center for children and seniors.
87  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Focus on Growth in Squirrel Hill and Beyond
Squirrel Hill remains both the geographic and institutional center of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish
community, and the Jewish community is growing there and in adjacent neighborhoods. The
density of the Jewish population and its institutions in Squirrel Hill make it an attractive
neighborhood for Jewish households looking to be especially active in Jewish life (140).
I think Squirrel Hill is an amazing asset to the Jewish community. Its a vibrant oasis of thriving Judaism in the
heart of the East End (which is the best part of Pittsburgh!). It is concentrated in one area of the city, which is good
because it really feels like a community.
Concentration in one central area that is a great walkable neighborhood.
Proximity to urban center.
The community is also growing in its suburbs in the North and South Hills, where communal
resources may not be as readily available. These suburbs must be supported to ensure that they will
continue to grow as hubs of Jewish life in Greater Pittsburgh. A total of 39 respondents indicated
that programs and activities in the suburbs were lacking, and 44 respondents indicated that
outreach to the suburbs would make them feel welcome.
Making an effort to include the suburban communities.
Have local branches in the suburbs other than downtown Pittsburgh so its easier to travel to activities.
There definitely seems to be a strong community, however, much of it is focused in the East End part of town. Living
in the South Hills, despite having two to three temples, there is a feeling that we are a minority and not connected to
the stronger community in Squirrel Hill.
Have more programs in the North Hills. There is very little offered for us here. We come in to the city for our
worship and programming.
Recognizing the Jewish families who live in the surrounding area beyond the North and South
Hills, who may not have the same access or opportunities to engage in Jewish communal life, is
also important. It may be worthwhile to reach out to Jewish residents and institutions of Beaver,
Butler, Washington, and Westmoreland counties to ensure that they feel the community is meeting
their needs.
I would like to see a greater connectioninclusion of Greensburg with the Pittsburgh area. We sometimes feel left out
and that is discouraging, because we would feel so much better if we were ALWAYS included.
There should be more available to those outside city limits if neededGreater Pittsburgh includes Westmoreland,
Washington, Fayette, Butler, Indiana counties for examplebut there is next to nothing available without travel to
Pittsburgh.
88  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Patterns of Jewish Engagement
The study was designed to help the Jewish community of Pittsburgh develop programs and
activities to enhance Jewish engagement. To aid the creation of initiatives that serve community
members where they are, the community must first follow a Talmudic dictum to go out and see
what the people are doing and construct their plans based on what they observe. In line with that
goal, survey responses were used to develop an Index of Jewish Engagement.
The categories that comprise Greater Pittsburghs Index of Jewish Engagement provide a new tool
for understanding the community. Five patterns of engagement were identified. The Immersed
pattern, which describes 16 of Jewish adults in the community, is actively engaged in all aspects
of Jewish life: home and synagoguebased holidays and ritual practices, personal activities, and
communal involvement. The Connected pattern, which describes 29 of Jewish adults, is actively
engaged in most aspects of Jewish life, but at lower rates than members of the Immersed group.
The Involved pattern also describes 29 of Jewish adults, who are highly engaged in Jewish
organizations aside from synagogues. The Holiday pattern, which describes 12 of Jewish adults,
reflects people who celebrate religious rituals associated with Jewish holidays but are not
particularly involved in synagogues or other Jewish organizations. Finally, the Minimally Involved
pattern describes the 13 of Jewish adults in the Pittsburgh area who are largely unaffiliated and
have little to no contact with Jewish organizations or institutions.
These patterns are not based on predefined labels; rather, they are developed from community
members actual behaviors across a variety of dimensions. The Index synthesizes many of these
behaviors and illustrates how they are patterned. It describes how each engagement group enacts
Judaism and reflects the diversity of behavior within extant demographic and interest groups. Each
group is diverse, including older and younger adults, inmarried and intermarried families,
households with and without children, newcomers to the community and those who have lived in
the area for decades, and people from all neighborhood groupings in the region. Denomination is
correlated with engagement group, but there are Orthodox individuals in nearly every engagement
group as well as people who do not identity with any particular denomination. Although the groups
reflect different patterns of behavior, they make it clear that simplistic dichotomiesengagednot
engaged and religiousnot religiousare inadequate descriptors of the nuances of communal and
private Jewish life in Greater Pittsburgh. Involving each group in Jewish life may require a different
approach. We hope that the Index will help Jewish organizations in Greater Pittsburgh to think
creatively about their engagement efforts.
Religious Diversity and Collaboration
The diversity of Jewish life in Pittsburgh is perceived by its members as a strength. Community
members feel that Pittsburgh offers abundant opportunities for Jews of all denominations and
levels of practice (177), and particularly value the ways that the denominations collaborate for
events and programs that are open to the entire community (151), specifically mentioning the
communitywide Tikkun Leil Shavuot (Shavuot study session).
89  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
There is a lot of diversitywhatever you are looking for in terms of involvement and community you can likely find a
congregation to meet your needswants.
There are many different synagogues and organizations that people can join in order to practice both the religious and
traditionalcultural aspects of Judaism, no matter what branch of Judaism they may practice.
So many different people from varying backgrounds and levels of faith, many synagogues and Jewish activities (social
action events etc.). Great Jewish friends and network. We also have a pluralistic chevra kadisha [Jewish burial
society] that I belong to.
I like that there is an openness across denominational lines. For the most part it doesn't seem to matter what type of
Jewish person you consider yourself, you are generally welcome at the mainstream Conservative, Reconstructionist, and
Reform congregations.
Activities that try to bring a crosssection of Jews together such as Mitzvah Day, Jewish Film Festival, etc.
Invest in Jewish Education
As the number of Jewish children in the Greater Pittsburgh area decreased between 2002 and 2017,
enrollment in local Jewish day schools, yeshivot, and Hebrew schools also declined. Based on the
demographic findings of the present study, however, it is likely that the community will have more
children of school age in the coming decade. Nearly 40 of Jewish children in the community
today are ages 05, and although adults ages 1829 constitute nearly 20 of the total Jewish
population, few of these young adults are parents. As they begin to start families, it is likely that the
number of children in the community will grow. It is critical for the community to continue to
invest in highquality Jewish educational programs and be prepared for likely increases in
enrollment in the next few years.
Pittsburghs schools and education system were identified as one of its strengths by 51
respondents.
JCC is the bedrock. JCC and Community Day School are the two most important organizations for the future of the
Pittsburgh Jewish community.
Community Day School is a tremendous asset that provides a topquality education for families of all Jewish
backgrounds regardless of ability to pay and fosters academic success and a love of Israel and Judaism.
Although 51 respondents highlighted the schools and educational offerings, 53 indicated
educational options that they felt were missing from the community. In particular, most of the 53
respondents mentioned the need for adult education, especially for the nonOrthodox and less
affiliated.
There is almost a total absence of adult education, especially free adult education, outside of the Orthodox
institutions.
I really miss the Agency for Jewish Learning! They were a central location for excellent classes. I also miss the weekly
morning Torah study that one of the Reform rabbis used to hold at a local coffee shop. It was a great way to study
and discuss in an informal setting and still get to work on time.
90  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Outreach to Intermarried Families
Few intermarried families in Greater Pittsburgh feel very much a part of the local Jewish
community, but these families have over onethird of all children in Jewish households in the area.
Of these children, onethird (33) are being raised exclusively Jewish, and another 11 are being
raised in both Judaism and another religion. About half of the children of intermarried parents are
being raised either in no religion, or their parents have not yet decided how to raise them. As these
children grow into adolescence and adulthood, it is likely they will wish to explore their heritage.
It is noteworthy that, for intermarried families who are raising their children Jewish in some way,
nearly as many are sending their children to Jewish preschool as are inmarried families. Ensuring
that there are highquality Jewish educational programs available for them is likely key to
developing their Jewish identities. If the community can increase its outreach to intermarried
families to make them feel more a part of the community, and if the community can offer them
programs that stimulate their interests and meet their needs, there may be a significant opportunity
to increase their Jewish engagement and encourage their children to develop their Jewish identities.
Interfaith couples and families felt that there were gaps in programs that met their needs (14) and
felt that the community could do more to make them feel welcome (35).
Understand and embrace interfaith relationshipsor youngadult children of interfaith relationships as a wholly
important future of the Pittsburgh Jewish Community.
Interfaith outreach that has Jewish content beyond food and happy hours.
Be more welcoming of those of us who are patrilineal Jews. Even with conversion and being ethnically Jewish, Im still
not welcomed in some areas of the Pittsburgh Jewish Community.
We have a mix of religions in our home, though in practice we only practice Judaism. We found that we were not
always welcomed or respected at [our area] congregations. Even Reform ones.
Focus on Young Adults
Jewish young adults in Greater Pittsburgh defy the stereotype of unengaged, disinterested young
Jews. The vast majority of Jewish young adults ages 1834 have some level of engagement with
Jewish institutions and activities, and their rates of organizational membership and ritual
observance typically match or exceed those of older adults in the community. Overall, Jewish
young adults in the community are pleased with the options available to them to engage in Jewish
life, but they would like local organizations that provide young adult programming to work more
collaboratively and less competitively.
91  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Young adults (57) described the types of programs that would be more appealing to them.
Cohesive young adult Jewish programming (there are a lot of separate groups that can be cliquey and plan over top of
one another).
A range of social opportunities for 20 to 30yearolds to meet each other in cultural, nonreligious settings and
programs that appeal to them.
Articulate a welcoming, spiritual, and socially aware vision of Judaism divorced from the guiltridden, intermarriage
isevil, Judaism must exist for its own sake that most Jewish organizations currently use to try to appeal to young
adultsmillennials. Come to where I am and meet my spiritualreligious needs, dont assume I fit the stereotype from
decades ago.
Diversity of Ages and Family Structure
Certain subgroups of the community, however, indicated that their needs were not fully met.
One possible unmet need is in providing services for those with health issues. Eight percent of
Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh include someone whose health issues constrained their
participation in Jewish life over the past year. Mobility issues, emotional challenges, and chronic
illnesses were the most common obstacles. Onequarter of Jewish households in the community
include at least one person who is limited in the amount of work, school, or housework he or she
can do as a result of an impairment, disability, or chronic physical or mental health condition.
Twentyeight percent of Pittsburghs Jewish adults are ages 65 and older, and 93 respondents
indicated that more services were needed for seniors. The most requested service was housing.
A senior life care community located within greater Pittsburgh.
For those who foresee the need to eventually move from our homes or apartments there is no facility in our area to
move without going to a retirement community sponsored by Christian organizations.
I wish the Jewish community offered more senior residences that are of good quality and not so very expensive.
Among Pittsburghs Jewish households, 28 include a person living alone. Onethird (33) of
single Jewish adults living alone are ages 65 or older, 41 ages 5064, and 26 under the age of 50.
Respondents (50) pointed out the needs for programs geared to singles of all ages, as well as adults
without children. A common theme was that programs were too focused on younger singles, and
on people with traditional family structures.
There are no programs for Jewish singles after the age of 30.
Services for mature singles (such as divorced people). Congregations do not reach out to this group either, which is why
I stopped membership to the congregation I had belonged to for many years.
Not everyone has a family. I am single and have no relatives in the area. It often seems as though so much is geared
towards families and family life.
92  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Dont assume everyone is heterosexual, looking for a partner, and childoriented.
Again....I cant stress this enough....everything is geared toward the assumption that everyone is always part of a
family.....I am not. I would like to be recognized as a valuable, lifelong, contributing member of the Jewish
community as an individual and not be overlooked or ignored or made to feel that my life experience and perspective
is irrelevant because I am not part of a family!!!
Promoting Ties to Israel
Nearly threefifths of Jewish adults in Greater Pittsburgh have visited Israel at least once. Seven
percent of Jewish adults say they have lived in Israel at some point, including about 3 who are
Israeli citizens. Pittsburgharea Jewish young adults have participated in Birthright Israel at high
rates, and many members of the community have visited on other educational or volunteer tours
or on a mission sponsored by Federation or another Jewish organization. Overall, nearly twothirds
of Jewish adults in the community feel somewhat or very connected to Israel, half seek news about
Israel at least once per week, and half say they have close friends or family living in Israel.
Despite these close ties to Israel, only about onequarter of Jewish adults in the community can
correctly identify KarmielMisgav as Pittsburghs partnership region in Israel. Another quarter say
they are aware that there is a partnership region but cannot identify it. Clearly, there is substantial
interest in Israel, and there is likely much that can be done to promote engagement by members of
the Pittsburgh Jewish community with their counterparts in KarmielMisgav.
Support for Families in Need
Collectively, the Jewish community of Greater Pittsburgh is mostly middle class, but nearly one
quarter of the community describes itself as just getting along, nearly poor, or poor. Sixteen
percent of households receive at least one public benefit that may be a measure of economic
insecurity. Four percent have felt constrained from participating in Jewish life due to financial
issues, particularly as a result of high program costs or fees or the cost of synagogue dues or High
Holy Day tickets. The proportion of Jewish households with significant economic pressures is
particularly high in the outlying areas farther from the geographic center of the community, where
the Jewish community has the most resources available to offer assistance. To best serve Jewish
families in need in the community, it may be necessary to raise the communitys awareness of
available resources, particularly for those who live outside of Squirrel Hill and the city of
Pittsburgh, and to raise additional resources to subsidize costs of participation or membership for
less affluent households.
The communitys finances were seen as a strength by 62 respondents, who remarked on the
charitable and generous nature of community members.
A group of people who have the financial capability to support those in the community who need the resources the
community provides.
93  2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study
Thirtytwo respondents said that affordability was a problem at schools, camps, and the JCC, and
32 said that scholarships and reduced costs would help them to participate in the community, in
particular with synagogue and JCC memberships.
I do feel that there is a big price tag to any organized Jewish community either through synagogue membership or JCC
membership. Thats unfortunate for unaffiliated Jews.
The membership dues of the JCC are extremely high. There are arrangements for those who cannot afford the dues,
and the ones who can do not have a problem. Those people who fall into the middle category are most affected.
I think that there could be more communitybased religious services that help make everyone feel welcome, and not
just people who are able to contribute financially.
Concluding Thoughts
The Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh has increased, and the community shows signs of
likely growth in the future. Although many members of the community appreciate its size, religious
diversity, and strong institutions, the data suggest many opportunities to strengthen Jewish
engagement and reach diverse populations. We hope that this portrait of the community will
stimulate a discussion about how to take advantage of the Pittsburgh Jewish communitys many
strengths.

24 Feelings of connection to the local Jewish community are highly correlated with proximity to the geographic center
of the Jewish community. Nearly threequarters (73 of the Immersed group live in Squirrel Hill or the rest of the City

connected to the local Jewish community, and 75 of Squirrel Hill residents and 60 of residents of the rest of the

higher than for other neighborhoods in Greater Pittsburgh. For more details, see Appendix C.

26 Because people in the Minimally Involved group may be less inclined to participate in a Jewish community survey, it

Where is the Land of Opportunity? The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in the United
States
Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez
NBER Working Paper No. 19843
January 2014
JEL No. H0,J0
ABSTRACT
We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to
describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the
joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child
income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent
income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility
varies substantially across areas within the U.S. For example, the probability that a child reaches the
top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4
in Charlotte but 12.9 in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility.
High mobility areas have (1) less residential segregation, (2) less income inequality, (3) better primary
schools, (4) greater social capital, and (5) greater family stability. While our descriptive analysis does
not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the new publicly available statistics
on intergenerational mobility by area developed here can facilitate future research on such mechanisms.

I Introduction
The United States is often hailed as the land of opportunity, a society in which a childs chances
of success depend little on her family background. Is this reputation warranted? We show that this
question does not have a clear answer because there is substantial variation in intergenerational
mobility across areas within the U.S. The U.S. is better described as a collection of societies, some
of which are lands of opportunity with high rates of mobility across generations, and others in
which few children escape poverty.
We characterize intergenerational mobility using information from deidentied federal income
tax records, which provide data on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents
between 1996 and 2012. We organize our analysis into three parts. In the rst section, we present
new statistics on intergenerational mobility in the U.S. as a whole. In our baseline analysis, we
focus on current U.S. citizens in the 19801982 birth cohorts  the oldest children in our data for
whom we can reliably identify parents based on information on dependent claiming. We measure
these childrens income as mean total family income in 2011 and 2012, when they are approximately
30 years old. We measure their parents income as mean family income between 1996 and 2000,
when the children are between the ages of 15 and 20.
The literature has identied two econometric challenges in estimating intergenerational mobility:
lifecycle bias due to measuring income at early or late ages and attenuation bias due to noise in
annual measures of income (e.g., Solon 1992, Zimmerman 1992, Mazumder 2005). We show that
estimates of intergenerational mobility stabilize when children reach their late twenties. Estimates
of mobility are insensitive to the age of parents and children at which parent income is measured,
provided that parent income is measured between age 30 and 55. We also show that using several
years of data to measure parent and child income does not substantially increase estimates of
mobility, perhaps because transitory measurement error is less prevalent in tax records than survey
data. These results indicate that our baseline income denitions do not suer from signicant
lifecycle or attenuation bias.
We begin our characterization of intergenerational mobility by regressing log child income on
log parent income, as in prior work. This specication yields an intergenerational elasticity (IGE)
estimate of 0.344, similar to Solons (1992) preferred estimates based on survey data. Although the
loglog specication has desirable theoretical properties (Solon 2004), it suers from two empirical
shortcomings. First, it omits observations with zero income. Since children of low income parents
1
are much more likely to have zero income, dropping these observations overstates mobility. Second,
the relationship between log child income and log parent income is highly nonlinear, with much
lower local IGEs below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile. These issues limit the
suitability of the loglog specication for crossarea comparisons, as IGE estimates are sensitive to
dierences in local income distributions.
To address these problems, we develop a rankrank specication similar to that used by Dahl
and DeLeire (2008). We rank children based on their incomes relative to other children in the
same birth cohort, including those with zero income. We rank parents of these children based
on their incomes relative to other parents with children in these birth cohorts. The relationship
between mean child ranks and parent ranks is almost perfectly linear. The slope of the rankrank
relationship is 0.341, i.e. a 10 percentile point increase in parent rank is associated with a 3.41
percentile increase in a childs income rank. Childrens college attendance and teenage birth rates
are also linearly related to parent income ranks. A 10 percentile point increase in parent income is
associated with a 6.7 percentage point (pp) increase in college attendance rates and a 3 pp reduction
in teenage birth rates for women.
In the second part of the paper, we use the rankrank specication to characterize variation
in intergenerational mobility across commuting zones (CZs). Commuting zones are geographical
aggregations of counties that are similar to metro areas but cover the entire U.S., including rural
areas (Tolbert and Sizer 1996). We assign children to commuting zones based on where they lived
at age 16  i.e., where they grew up  irrespective of whether they left that CZ afterward. When
analyzing CZs, we continue to rank both children and parents based on their positions in the
national income distribution, allowing us to measure childrens absolute outcomes as we discuss
below.
The relationship between mean child ranks and parent ranks remains almost perfectly linear
within commuting zones, allowing us to summarize the conditional expectation of a childs rank
given his parents rank with just two parameters: a slope and intercept. The slope measures relative
mobility: the dierence in outcomes between children from top vs. bottom income families within
a CZ. The intercept measures the expected rank for children from families at the bottom of the
income distribution. Combining the intercept and slope for a CZ, we can calculate the expected
rank of children from families at any given percentile pof the national parent income distribution.
We term this measure absolute mobility at percentile p. Measuring absolute mobility is valuable
because increases in relative mobility have ambiguous normative implications, as they may be
2
driven by worse outcomes for the rich rather than better outcomes for the poor.
We nd substantial variation in both relative and absolute mobility across CZs. Relative mo
bility is lowest for children who grew up in the Southeast and highest in the Mountain West and
the rural Midwest. 1 Some CZs in the U.S. have relative mobility comparable to the highest mo
bility countries in the world, such as Denmark, while others have lower levels of mobility than any
developed country for which data are available.
We nd similar geographical variation in absolute mobility. We focus much of our analysis on
absolute mobility at p  25, which we term absolute upward mobility. This statistic measures
the mean income rank of children with parents in the bottom half of the income distribution given
linearity of the rankrank relationship. Absolute upward mobility ranges from 35.8 in Charlotte to
46.2 in Salt Lake City among the 50 largest CZs. Overall, a 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in
CZlevel upward mobility is associated with a 0.2 SD improvement in a childs expected rank given
parents at p 25, 60 as large as the eect of a 1 SD increase in her own parents income. Other
measures of upward mobility exhibit similar spatial variation. For instance, the probability that a
child reaches the top fth of the income distribution conditional on having parents in the bottom
fth is 4.4 in Charlotte, compared with 10.8 in Salt Lake City and 12.9 in San Jose. The
CZlevel mobility statistics are also robust to adjusting for dierences in the local costofliving,
shocks to local growth, and using alternative measures of income.
Absolute upward mobility is highly correlated with relative mobility: areas with high levels of
relative mobility (low rankrank slopes) tend to have better outcomes for children from lowincome
families. On average, children from families below percentile p  85 have better outcomes when
relative mobility is greater; those above p 85 have worse outcomes. An important consequence of
this result is that location matters most for children from low income families: the expected rank of
children from lowincome families varies more across CZs than the expected rank of children from
high income families.
The spatial patterns of the gradients of college attendance and teenage birth rates with respect
to parent income across CZs are very similar to the pattern in intergenerational income mobility.
The fact that much of the spatial variation in childrens outcomes emerges before they enter the
labor market suggests that the dierences in mobility are driven by factors that aect children
while they are growing up.
1The fact that we dene location based on where children grew up is important here. Successful children who
grow up in rural areas often work in a dierent CZ (e.g., a nearby city) as adults.
3
In the nal part of the paper, we explore such factors by correlating the spatial variation in
mobility with observable characteristics. We begin by showing that upward income mobility is
signicantly lower in areas with larger AfricanAmerican populations. However, white individuals
in areas with large AfricanAmerican populations also have lower rates of upward mobility, implying
that racial shares matter at the community (rather than individual) level. One mechanism for such
a communitylevel eect of race is segregation. Areas with larger black populations tend to be more
segregated by income and race, which could aect both white and black lowincome individuals
adversely. Indeed, we nd a strong negative correlation between standard measures of racial and
income segregation and upward mobility. Moreover, we also nd that upward mobility is higher in
cities with less sprawl, as measured by commute times to work. These ndings lead us to identify
segregation as the rst of ve broad factors that are strongly correlated with mobility.
The second factor we explore is inequality. CZs with larger Gini coecients have less upward
mobility, consistent with the Great Gatsby curve documented across countries (Krueger 2012,
Corak 2013). In contrast, top 1 income shares are not highly correlated with intergenerational
mobility both across CZs within the U.S. and across countries. Although one cannot draw denitive
conclusions from such correlations, they suggest that the factors that erode the middle class hamper
intergenerational mobility more than the factors that lead to income growth in the upper tail.
Third, proxies for the quality of the K12 school system are also correlated with mobility. Areas
with higher test scores (controlling for income levels), lower dropout rates, and smaller class sizes
have higher rates of upward mobility. In addition, areas with higher local tax rates, which are
predominantly used to nance public schools, have higher rates of mobility.
Fourth, social capital indices (Putnam 1995)  which are proxies for the strength of social
networks and community involvement in an area  are very strongly correlated with mobility. For
instance, high upward mobility areas tend to have higher fractions of religious individuals and
greater participation in local civic organizations.
Finally, the strongest predictors of upward mobility are measures of family structure such as
the fraction of single parents in the area. As with race, parents marital status does not matter
purely through its eects at the individual level. Children of married parents also have higher rates
of upward mobility if they live in communities with fewer single parents.
We nd modest correlations between upward mobility and local tax and government expenditure
policies and no systematic correlation between mobility and local labor market conditions, rates of
migration, or access to higher education. In a multiple regression, the ve key factors described
4
above generally remain statistically signicant predictors of both relative and absolute upward
mobility, even in specications with state xed eects. However, we emphasize that these factors
should not be interpreted as causal determinants of mobility because all of these variables are
endogenous and our analysis does not control for numerous other unobserved dierences across
areas.
Our results build on and contribute to an extensive empirical literature on intergenerational
mobility, reviewed by Solon (1999), Grawe and Mulligan (2002), and Black and Devereux (2011).
Several studies have compared mobility across countries using a loglog specication and have
found that relative mobility is lower in the U.S. than in other developed countries (e.g., Bjorklund
and J antti 1997, J antti et al. 2006, Corak 2013). Our estimates of the IGE in the U.S. as a
whole are similar to those found in prior work, with the exception of Mazumders (2005) widely
cited estimates, which imply much lower levels of intergenerational mobility than we nd here for
reasons we explain in Online Appendix C. Our analysis is most closely related to contemporaneous
work by Graham and Sharkey (2013), who use survey data to estimate relative mobility using
loglog specications in a subset of cities in the U.S. Their estimates are correlated with ours, but
do not permit an assessment of absolute mobility and are naturally less precise due to limitations
in sample size.
Our approach of withincountry comparisons oers two advantages over the crosscountry com
parisons that have been the focus of prior comparative work. First, dierences in measurement and
econometric methods make it dicult to reach denitive conclusions from crosscountry compar
isons (Solon 2002, Black and Devereux 2011). The income measures and covariates we analyze here
are all measured using the same data sources across all CZs. Second, and more importantly, we can
characterize both relative and absolute mobility across CZs by using national ranks to measure chil
drens outcomes. The crosscountry literature has focused on dierences in relative mobility, partly
because it is dicult to compare the absolute standard of living across very dierent economies.
Although the literature on crosscountry dierences in economic growth has characterized dier
ences in mean absolute living standards across nations, much less is known about how the prospects
of children from lowincome families vary across countries when measured on a common absolute
scale (Ray 2010).
Our analysis also relates to the literature on neighborhood eects, reviewed by Jencks and Mayer
(1990) and Sampson et al. (2002). Many of the correlations we explore are motivated by hypotheses
proposed in this literature, such as the impacts of concentrated poverty (Wilson 1987), residential
5
segregation (Massey and Denton 1993, Cutler and Glaeser 1997), social capital (Coleman 1988,
Putnam 1995), and local school quality (Card and Krueger 1992). However, unlike recent exper
imental and quasiexperimental work on neighborhood eects (e.g., Katz et al. 2001, Oreopoulos
2003), our descriptive analysis does not shed light on whether the dierences in outcomes across
areas are due to the causal eect of neighborhoods or dierences in the characteristics of people
living in those neighborhoods.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data. Section III
reports estimates of intergenerational mobility at the national level. In Section IV, we present
estimates of absolute and relative mobility by commuting zone. Section V reports correlations of
our mobility measures with observable characteristics of commuting zones. Section VI concludes.
Statistics on intergenerational mobility and related covariates are publicly available by commuting
zone, metropolitan statistical area, and county on the project website.
II Data
We use data from federal income tax records spanning 19962012. The data include both income
tax returns (1040 forms) and thirdparty information returns (e.g., W2 forms), which give us
information on the earnings of those who do not le tax returns. We provide a detailed description
of how we construct our analysis sample starting from the raw population data in Online Appendix
A. Here, we briey summarize the key variable and sample denitions. Note that in what follows,
the year always refers to the tax year (i.e., the calendar year in which the income is earned).
II.A Sample Denitions
Our base dataset of children consists of all individuals who (1) have a valid Social Security Number
or Individual Taxpayer Identication Number, (2) were born between 19801991, and (3) are U.S.
citizens as of 2013. We impose the citizenship requirement to exclude individuals who are likely to
have immigrated to the U.S. as adults, for whom we cannot measure parent income. We cannot
directly restrict the sample to individuals born in the U.S. because the database only records current
citizenship status.
We identify the parents of a child as the rst tax lers (between 19962012) who claim the child
as a child dependent and were between the ages of 15 and 40 when the child was born. If the child is
rst claimed by a single ler, the child is dened as having a single parent. For simplicity, we assign
each child a parent (or parents) permanently using this algorithm, regardless of any subsequent
6
changes in parents marital status or dependent claiming. 2
If parents never le a tax return, we cannot link them to their child. Although some lowincome
individuals do not le tax returns in a given year, almost all parents le a tax return at some point
between 1996 and 2012 to obtain a tax refund on their withheld taxes and the Earned Income
Tax Credit (Cilke 1998). As a result, we are able to identify parents for approximately 95 of
the children in the 19801991 birth cohorts. 3 Because we have more opportunities to link younger
children to their parents, the fraction of children linked to parents rises from approximately 90
for the early birth cohorts to nearly 99 for the most recent birth cohorts (Online Appendix Table
I).4 The fraction of children linked to parents drops sharply prior to the 1980 birth cohort because
our data begin in 1996 and many children begin to the leave the household starting at age 17. This
is why we limit our analysis to children born during or after 1980.
Our primary analysis sample, which we refer to as the core sample, includes all children in the
base dataset who (1) are born in the 198082 birth cohorts, (2) for whom we are able to identify
parents, and (3) whose mean parent income between 19962000 is strictly positive (which excludes
1.2 of children).5 For some robustness checks, we use theextended sample, which imposes the same
restrictions as the core sample, but includes all birth cohorts 19801991. There are approximately
10 million children in the core sample and 44 million children in the extended sample.
Statistics of Income Sample. Because we can only reliably link children to parents starting
with the 1980 birth cohort in the population tax data, we can only measure earnings of children
up to age 32 (in 2012) in the full sample. To evaluate whether estimates of intergenerational
mobility would change signicantly if earnings were measured at later ages, we supplement our
analysis using annual crosssections of tax returns maintained by the Statistics of Income (SOI)
division of the Internal Revenue Service prior to 1996. The SOI crosssections provide identiers for
dependents claimed on tax forms starting in 1987, allowing us to link parents to children back to
the 1971 birth cohort using an algorithm analogous to that described above (see Online Appendix
212 of children in our core sample are claimed as dependents by dierent individuals in subsequent years. To
ensure that this potential measurement error in linking children to parents does not aect our ndings, we show that
we obtain similar estimates of mobility for the subset of children who are never claimed by other individuals (row 9
of Table V).
3Chetty et al. (2013) present further evidence that one can identify parents for virtually all children who grew up
in the U.S. by showing that 98 of children enrolled in a large school district in grades 38 can be linked to parents
in the tax data.
4To ensure that our results are not biased by the missing data in the early cohorts, we also replicate our analysis
restricting the sample to more recent birth cohorts (see rows 5 and 6 of Table V).
5We limit the sample to parents with positive income because parents who le a tax return (as required to link
them to a child) yet have zero income are unlikely to be representative of individuals with zero income and those
with negative income typically have large capital losses, which are a proxy for having signicant wealth.
7
A for further details). The SOI crosssections are stratied random samples of tax returns with
a sampling probability that rises with income; using sampling weights, we can calculate statistics
representative of the national distribution. After linking parents to children in the SOI sample,
we use population tax data to obtain data on income for children and parents, using the same
denitions as in the core sample. There are approximately 63,000 children in the 197179 birth
cohorts in the SOI sample (Online Appendix Table II).
II.B Variable Denitions and Summary Statistics
In this section, we dene the key variables we use to measure intergenerational mobility. We
measure all monetary variables in 2012 dollars, adjusting for ination using the consumer price
index (CPIU).
Parent Income. Following Lee and Solon (2009), our primary measure of parent income is total
pretax income at the household level, which we labelparent family income. More precisely, in years
where a parent les a tax return, we dene family income as Adjusted Gross Income (as reported on
the 1040 tax return) plus taxexempt interest income and the nontaxable portion of Social Security
and Disability benets. In years where a parent does not le a tax return, we dene family income
as the sum of wage earnings (reported on form W2), unemployment benets (reported on form
1099G), and gross social security and disability benets (reported on form SSA1099) for both
parents.6 In years where parents have no tax return and no information returns, family income is
coded as zero.
Note that this income measure includes labor earnings and capital income as well as unem
ployment insurance, social security, and disability benets. It excludes nontaxable cash transfers
such as TANF and SSI, inkind benets such as food stamps, all refundable tax credits such as
the EITC, nontaxable pension contributions (e.g., to 401(k)s), and any earned income not re
ported to the IRS. Income is always measured prior to the deduction of individual income taxes
and employeelevel payroll taxes.
In our baseline analysis, we average parents family income over the ve years from 1996 to 2000
to reduce noise due to transitory uctuations (Solon 1992). We use the earliest years in our sample
to best reect the economic resources of parents while the children in our sample are growing up. 7
6The database does not record W2s and other information returns prior to 1999, so nonlers income is coded as
0 prior to 1999. We verify that this is not an important source of bias by showing in Table V (row 18) that we obtain
very similar results when dening parent income only using post1999 data. We cannot observe selfemployment
income for nonlers and therefore code it as zero; given the strong incentives for individuals with children to le
created by the EITC, most nonlers likely have very low levels of selfemployment income.
7Formally, we dene mean family income as the mothers family income plus the fathers family income in each
8
We evaluate the robustness of our ndings using a measure of individual parent income instead
of family income. For single parents, parent family income coincides with individual income. For
married parents, we dene each parents individual earnings as the sum of wage earnings from
form W2, unemployment benets from form 1099G, and Social Security and Disability benets
from form SSA1099 for that individual. Individual earnings excludes capital and other nonlabor
income. To incorporate these sources of income, we add half of family nonlabor income  dened as
total family income minus total family earnings reported on form 1040  to each parents individual
earnings. We divide nonlabor earnings equally between spouses because we cannot identify which
spouse earns nonlabor income from the 1040 tax return.
Child Income. We dene child family income in exactly the same way as parent family income.
In our baseline analysis, we average child family income over the last two years in our data (2011 and
2012). We use the most recent two years because the children in our sample are all born after 1980,
and income in the early 30s provides a better measure of lifetime income than income at earlier
ages (Haider and Solon 2006). We report results using alternative years to assess the sensitivity of
our ndings. For children, we dene household income based on current marital status rather than
marital status at a xed point in time. Because family income varies with marital status, we also
report results using individual income measures for children, constructed in exactly the same way
as for parents.
College Attendance. We dene college attendance as an indicator for having one or more 1098T
forms led on ones behalf when the individual is aged 1821. Title IV institutions  all colleges and
universities as well as vocational schools and other postsecondary institutions eligible for federal
student aid  are required to le 1098T forms that report tuition payments or scholarships received
for every student. Because the 1098T forms are led directly by colleges independent of whether
an individual les a tax return, we have complete records on college attendance for all children.
The 1098T data are available from 19992012. Comparisons to other data sources indicate that
1098T forms capture college enrollment quite accurately overall (Chetty, Friedman, and Rocko
2013, Section 3.1).8
year from 1996 to 2000 divided by 10 (or divided by 5 if we only identify a single parent). For parents who do
not change marital status, this is simply mean family income over the 5 year period. For parents who are married
initially and then divorce, this measure tracks the mean family incomes of the two divorced parents over time. For
parents who are single initially and then get married, this measure tracks individual income prior to marriage and
total family income (including the new spouses income) after marriage. These household measures of income increase
with marriage and naturally do not account for cohabitation; to ensure that these features do not generate bias, we
assess the robustness of our results to using individual measures of income.
8Colleges are not required to le 1098T forms for students whose qualied tuition and related expenses are
waived or paid entirely with scholarships or grants. However, the forms are frequently available even for such cases,
9
Teenage Birth. We dene a woman as having a teenage birth if she ever claims a dependent
who was born while she was between the ages of 13 and 19. This measure is an imperfect proxy
for having a teenage birth because it only covers children who are claimed as dependents by their
mothers. Fortunately, the aggregate level and spatial pattern of teenage births in our data are
closely aligned with estimates based on the American Community Survey. 9
Summary Statistics. Table I reports summary statistics for the core sample. Median parent
family income is 60,129 (in 2012 dollars). Among the 30.6 of children matched to single parents,
72.0 are matched to a female parent. Children in our core sample have a median family income
of 34,975 when they are approximately 30 years old. 6.1 of children have zero income in both
2011 and 2012. 58.9 are enrolled in a college at some point between the ages of 18 and 21 and
15.9 of women have a teenage birth.
In Online Appendix Table III, we show that the total cohort size, labor force participation
rate, distribution of child income, and other demographic characteristics of our core sample line up
closely with corresponding estimates in the Current Population Survey and American Community
Survey. This conrms that our sample covers roughly the same nationally representative population
as previous surveybased research.
III National Statistics
We begin our empirical analysis by characterizing the relationship between parent and child income
at the national level. We rst present a set of baseline estimates of intergenerational income mobility
and then evaluate the robustness of our estimates to alternative sample and income denitions.
III.A Baseline Estimates
In our baseline analysis, we use the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and measure parent income
as mean family income from 19962000 and child income as mean family income in 201112, when
children are approximately 30 years old. Figure Ia presents a binned scatter plot of the mean
family income of children versus the mean family income of their parents. To construct this gure,
we divide the x axis into 100 equalsized (percentile) bins and plot mean child income vs. mean
presumably because of automated reporting to the IRS by universities. Approximately 6 of 1098T forms are
missing from 20002003 because the database contains no 1098T forms for some small colleges in these years. To
verify that this does not aect our results, we conrm that our estimates of college attendance by parent income
gradients are very similar for later birth cohorts (not reported).
915.8 of women in our core sample have teenage births; the corresponding number is 14.6 in the 2003 ACS.
The unweighted correlation between statelevel teenage birth rates in the tax data and the ACS is 0.80.
10
parent income in each bin. For scaling purposes, we exclude the top bin (children of parents in
the top 1) in this gure only. This binned scatter plot provides a nonparametric representation
of the conditional expectation of child income given parent income. The regression coecients
and standard errors reported in this and all subsequent binned scatter plots are estimated on the
underlying microdata using OLS regressions.
The conditional expectation of childrens income given parents income is strongly concave.
Below the 90th percentile of parent income, a 1 increase in parent family income is associated
with a 33.5 cent increase in average child family income. In contrast, between the 90th and 99th
percentile, a 1 increase in parent income is associated with only a 7.6 cent increase in child income.
Partly motivated by this nonlinearity, much of the empirical literature has estimated regressions
of log child income on log parent income. The slope of this regression measures the elasticity of child
income with respect to parent income, commonly termed the intergenerational income elasticity
(IGE). We implement this specication in the rst column of row 1 of Table II, excluding children
with zero income as in prior work. We obtain an IGE estimate of 0.344, similar to the estimates of
Solon (1992) and Zimmerman (1992) in survey data when using multiyear income averages.
The remaining columns in the rst row of Table II replicate the loglog specication for alter
native samples analyzed in the prior literature. Columns 25 split the sample by the childs gender
and the parents marital status in the year they rst claim the child. Column 6 replicates Column
1 for the extended sample of 198085 birth cohorts. The IGE estimates are similar for males and
females, but are lower when we condition on marital status and use the extended sample for reasons
we explain below in Section III.B.
While the loglog specication is a familiar and intuitive benchmark, it suers from two short
comings that are illustrated in Figure Ib. First, the relationship between log child income and
log parent income is highly nonlinear, consistent with the ndings of Corak and Heisz (1999) in
Canadian tax data. This is illustrated in the series in circles in Figure Ib, which plots mean log
child income vs. mean log family income by percentile bin, constructed using the same method as
Figure Ia. Because of this nonlinearity, the IGE is sensitive to the point of measurement in the
income distribution. For example, restricting the sample to observations between the 10th and 90th
percentile of parent income (denoted by the vertical dashed lines in the graph) yields a considerably
higher IGE estimate of 0.452.
Second, the loglog specication discards observations with zero income. The series in triangles
in Figure Ib plots the fraction of children with zero income by parental income bin. This fraction
11
varies from 18 among the poorest families to 3 among the richest families. Dropping children
with zero income therefore overstates the degree of intergenerational mobility. The way in which
these zeros are treated can change the IGE dramatically. For instance, including the zeros by
assigning those with zero income an income of 1 (so that the log of their income is zero) raises the
estimated IGE to 0.618, as shown in row 2 of Table II. If instead we treat those with 0 income as
having an income of 1,000, the estimated IGE becomes 0.413. Hence, small dierences in the way
childrens income is measured at the bottom of the distribution can produce substantial variation
in IGE estimates.
To address these shortcomings of the loglog specication, we use a rankrank specication
similar to that proposed by Dahl and DeLeire (2008). We measure the percentile rank of the parent
based on their position in the distribution of parent incomes in the core sample. Similarly, we dene
childrens percentile ranks based on their positions in the distribution of child incomes within their
birth cohorts. Importantly, this denition allows us to include zeros in child income. 10 Unless
otherwise noted, we hold the denition of these ranks xed based on positions in the aggregate
distribution, even when analyzing subgroups.
Figure IIa presents a binned scatter plot of the mean percentile rank of children vs. their
parents percentile rank. The conditional expectation of a childs rank given her parents rank is
almost perfectly linear. Using an OLS regression, we estimate that a one percentage point (pp)
increase in parent rank is associated with a 0.341 pp increase in the childs expected rank, as
reported in row 4 of Table II.
Figure IIb compares the rankrank relationship in the U.S. with analogous estimates for Den
mark constructed using data from Boserup et al. (2013). 11 The relationship between child and
parent ranks is nearly linear in Denmark as well, suggesting that the rankrank specication can
provide a good parametric summary of mobility across diverse environments. The rankrank slope
in Denmark is 0.180, nearly half that in the U.S. This corroborates prior ndings that Scandinavian
economies have much greater relative intergenerational mobility than the United States.
Importantly, the smaller rankrank slope in Denmark does not necessarily mean that children
from lowincome families in Denmark do better than those in the U.S. in absolute terms. It could be
10In the case of ties, we dene the rank as the mean rank for the individuals in that group. For example, if 10
of a birth cohort has zero income, all children with zero income would receive a percentile rank of 5.
11The Danish sample uses the 198081 birth cohorts and measures child income based on mean income between
200911. Because of dierences in the structure of the administrative database, child income in the Danish sample is
measured at the individual level and parents income is the mean of the two biological parents income from 19971999,
irrespective of their marital status.
12
that children of highincome parents in Denmark have worse outcomes than children of highincome
parents in the U.S., in which case the greater relative mobility in Denmark may be undesirable. One
cannot distinguish between these possibilities based on Figure IIb because the ranks are dened
within each country. One advantage of the withinU.S. CZlevel analysis implemented below is
that it naturally allows us to study both relative and absolute outcomes by analyzing childrens
performance on a xed national scale.
Transition Matrices. Although the rankrank relationship has attractive statistical properties,
there are many other measures of mobility that may be of normative interest (see e.g., Fields and
Ok 1999). For example, one popular approach is to analyze transition matrices (e.g., Corak and
Heisz 1999, Hertz 2006, J antti et al. 2006). Table III presents a quintile transition matrix: the
probability that a child is in quintile m of the child income distribution conditional on his parent
being in quintile n of the parent income distribution. One statistic of particular interest in this
matrix is the probability of moving from the bottom quintile to the top quintile, a simple measure of
success that we analyze below. This probability is 7.5 in the U.S. as a whole. Another notable
feature of the matrix is that the rate of persistence in the bottom quintile (33.7) is similar to the
rate of persistence in the top quintile (36.5).
To facilitate the construction of other measures of mobility, we report a 100 x 100 percentile
level transition matrix for the U.S. in Online Data Table I. Using this matrix  which characterizes
the copula of the joint distribution of parent and child income  and the marginal distributions for
child and parent income reported in Online Data Table II, one can construct any mobility statistic
of interest for the U.S. population.
III.B Robustness of Baseline Estimates
We now evaluate the robustness of our estimates of the degree of intergenerational persistence in in
come to alternative specications. We begin by evaluating two potential sources of bias emphasized
in prior work: lifecycle bias and attenuation bias.
Lifecycle Bias. Prior research has shown that measuring childrens income at early ages can
understate intergenerational persistence in lifetime income because children with high lifetime in
comes are in college and have steeper earnings proles when they are young (Haider and Solon,
2006, Grawe, 2006, Solon 1999). To evaluate whether our baseline estimates suer from such lifecy
cle bias, Figure IIIa plots estimates of the rankrank slope by the age at which the childs income is
measured. To construct this gure, we measure childrens income as mean family income in 2011
13
2012 and parent income as mean family income between 19962000, as in our baseline analysis. We
then replicate the OLS regression of child income rank on parent income rank for each birth cohort
between 19801990. For children in the 1980 birth cohort, we measure earnings in 201112 at age
3132 (denoted by 32 in the gure); for the 1990 cohort, we measure earnings at age 2122. 12 The
rankrank slope rises very steeply in the early 20s as children enter the labor force, but stabilizes
around age 30. It increases by 2.1 from age 30 to 31 and 0.2 from age 31 to 32.
To obtain estimates beyond age 32, we use the SOI 0.1 random sample described in Section
II.A, which contains data back to the 1971 birth cohort. The series in triangles in Figure IIIa
replicates the analysis above within the SOI sample, using sampling weights to recover estimates
representative of the population. The estimates in the SOI sample are very similar to those in
the full population prior to age 32. After age 32, the estimates remain roughly constant. These
ndings indicate that rankrank correlations exhibit little lifecycle bias provided that child income
is measured after age 30, as in our baseline denition. Estimates of the IGE using the traditional
loglog specication also stabilize around age 30 (not reported).
An analogous lifecycle bias can arise if parent income is measured at very old or young ages. In
Online Appendix Figure Ia we plot the rankrank slope using the core sample, varying the 5year
window used to measure parent income from a starting year of 1996 (when parents are 41 years old
on average) to 2007 (when parents are 55 years old). The rankrank estimates exhibit virtually no
variation with the age of parent income measurement within this range.
A closely related concern is that parent income at earlier ages might matter more for childrens
outcomes, e.g. if resources in early childhood are relevant for child development (e.g., Heckman
2006, Duncan et al. 2010). While we cannot measure parent income before age 14 for children in our
core sample, we can measure parent income at earlier ages for later birth cohorts. In Chetty et al.
(2014), we use data from the 1993 birth cohort and regress an indicator for college attendance at age
19 on parent income rank in each year from 1996 to 2012. We reproduce the coecients from those
regressions in Online Appendix Figure Ib. The relationship between college attendance rates and
parent income rank is virtually constant when children are between ages 3 and 19. Once again, this
result indicates that the point at which parent income is measured (provided parents are between
ages 3055) does not signicantly aect intergenerational associations, at least in administrative
12We vary birth cohort and hold the year of income measurement xed to eliminate calendar year eects. We
obtain very similar results if we instead track a single cohort and vary age by measuring earnings in dierent calendar
years.

Attenuation Bias. Income in a single year is a noisy measure of permanent income because
of transitory shocks and measurement error. Solon (1992), Zimmerman (1992), and Mazumder
(2005) show that using multiyear means of parent income generate signicantly higher estimates
of intergenerational persistence in survey data. To evaluate whether our baseline estimates suer
from such attenuation bias, Figure IIIb plots estimates of the rankrank slope, varying the number of
years used to calculate mean parent family income. To construct this gure, we measure childrens
income as mean family income in 20112012 and use the core sample of 198082 birth cohorts. We
then replicate the OLS regression of child rank on parent rank, varying the number of years used
to calculate mean parent income from one (1996 only) to 17 (19962012).
Consistent with the ndings of Solon (1992), we nd that the rankrank slope rises when we
increase the number of years used to measure parent income from one to ve. However, the rank
rank slope based on ve years (0.341) is only 6.5 larger than the slope based on one year of parent
income (0.320). This 6.5 attenuation bias is considerably smaller than the 33 change in the
IGE (from 0.3 to 0.4) reported by Solon (1992) when using a veyear average instead of one year
of data. We nd less attenuation bias for three reasons: (1) income is measured with less error in
the tax data than in the PSID, (2) we use family income measures rather than individual income,
which uctuates more across years, and (3) we use a rankrank specication rather than a loglog
specication, which is more sensitive to income uctuations at the bottom of the distribution.
Contrary to the ndings of Mazumder (2005), the rankrank slope is virtually unchanged by
adding more years of data beyond ve years: the estimated slope using 15 years of data to measure
parent income (0.350) is only 2.8 larger than the baseline slope of 0.341 using 5 years of data. We
believe our results dier because we directly measure parent income, whereas Mazumder imputes
parent income based on race and education for up to 60 of the observations in his sample (see
Online Appendix C for further details).
Prior studies have focused on measurement error in parent income rather than childrens in
come because only the former generates attenuation bias in the standard OLS loglog regression
specication, insofar as the transitory measurement error in child income is unrelated to parent
income. This is not true in a rankrank specication because the measurement error in childrens
13While we cannot measure income before the year in which children turn 3, the fact that the collegeincome
gradient is not declining from ages 319 makes it unlikely that the gradient is signicantly larger prior to age 2.
Parent income ranks in year t have a correlation of 0.91 with parent income ranks in year t 1, 0.77 in year t 5,
and 0.65 in year t 15. The decay in this autocorrelation would generate a decreasing slope in the gradient in Online
Appendix Figure Ib if there were a discontinuous jump in the gradient prior to age 2.
15
income generates misclassication error in their ranks, which can attenuate the rankrank slope. 14
To evaluate the magnitude of this bias, we analyze the impact of varying the number of years
used to measure the childs income in Online Appendix Figure Ic. The rankrank slope increases
only modestly when increasing the number of years used to compute child family income, with no
detectable change once one averages over at least two years, as in our baseline measure. 15
Alternative Income Denitions. In rows 57 of Table II, we explore the robustness of the
baseline rankrank estimate to alternative denitions of child and parent income. In row 5 we
dene the parents rank based on the individual income of the parent with higher mean income
from 19992003.16 This specication eliminates the mechanical variation in family income driven
by the number of parents in the household, which could overstate the persistence of income across
generations if parent marital status has a direct eect of childrens outcomes. The rankrank
correlation falls by approximately 10, from 0.341 to 0.312 when we use top parent income. The
impact of using individual parent income instead of family income is modest because (1) most of the
variation in parent income across households is not due to dierences in marital status and (2) the
mean ranks of children with married parents are only 4.6 percentile points higher than those with
single parents. The same logic explains why we nd a similar 10 reduction when we condition on
marital status in the baseline specication using family income (columns 4 and 5 of row 4).
In row 6 of Table II, we repeat this exercise for children. Here, the concern is that children of
higher income parents may be more likely to marry, again exaggerating the observed persistence in
family income relative to individual income. Using individual income to measure the childs rank
has dierential impacts by the childs gender, consistent with Chadwick and Solon (2002). For male
children, using individual income instead of family income reduces the rankrank correlation from
0.336 in the baseline specication to 0.317, a 6 reduction. For female children, using individual
income reduces the rankrank correlation from 0.346 to 0.257, a 26 reduction. These dierences
are likely driven by assortative mating: women with higher income parents marry men who earn
more, driving up the persistence of family income across generations.
14Formally, measurement error in the childs rank is correlated with the parents rank because the support of the
childs rank is bounded. Intuitively, children from the highestranked families are more likely to be underranked
than overranked due to measurement error in their income. As a result, measurement error in childrens or parents
income generally leads to attenuation bias in a rankrank specication.
15An ancillary implication of this result is that our estimates of intergenerational mobility are not sensitive to the
specic calendar years used to measure child income.
16We use 19992003 income here because we cannot allocate earnings across spouses before 1999, as W2 forms are
available starting only in 1999. Note that top income rank diers from family income rank even for single parents
because some individuals get married in subsequent years and because these individuals are ranked relative to the
population, not relative to other single individuals.
16
Finally, in row 7 of Table II, we dene a measure of child income that excludes capital and
other nonlabor income using the sum of individual wage earnings, UI benets, SSDI benets,
and Schedule C selfemployment income. We divide selfemployment income by 2 for married
individuals. This individual earnings measure yields virtually identical estimates of the rankrank
correlation.
We conclude that our baseline measure of intergenerational persistence accurately captures the
degree of persistence in lifetime income across generations and focus primarily on this measure in
the remainder of the paper.
III.C College Attendance and Teenage Birth Gradients
We supplement our analysis of intergenerational income mobility by studying the relationship
between parent income and two additional outcomes for children: college attendance and teenage
birth. Figure IV presents binned scatter plots of the college attendance rate of children (in Panel
A) and the teenage birth rate for female children (in Panel B) vs. the percentile rank of parent
family income using the core sample. Parent rank is dened as in the baseline specication in row
4 of Table II. College attendance is dened as attending college in one or more years between the
ages 18 and 21, while teenage birth is dened (for females only) as having a child when the mother
is aged 1319; see section II.B for further details.
The relationships between both outcomes and parental income rank are again virtually linear.
The slope for college attendance is 0.675. That is, moving from the lowestincome to highestincome
parents increases the college attendance rate by 67.5 percentage points, similar to the estimates
reported by Bailey and Dynarski (2011) using survey data. The slope of the relationship between
teenage birth rates and parental income rank is 0.30. These substantial correlations suggest that
much of the divergence in outcomes between children from low vs. high income families emerges
well before they enter the labor market, a point we return to below when exploring spatial variation.
IV Spatial Variation in Mobility
We now turn to our central goal of characterizing the variation in intergenerational mobility across
areas within the U.S. We begin by dening measures of geographic location. Next, we dene two
concepts of intergenerational mobility  relative mobility and absolute mobility  that we measure
using a rankrank specication. Finally, we present estimates of relative and absolute mobility by
area and assess the robustness of these estimates to alternative measures.
17
IV.A Geographical Units
To characterize the variation in childrens outcomes across areas, one must rst partition the U.S.
into a set of geographical areas in which children grow up. One way to conceptualize the choice of
a geographical partition is using a hierarchical model in which childrens outcomes depend upon
conditions in their immediate neighborhood (e.g., peers or resources in their city block), local
community (e.g., the quality of schools in their county), and broader metro area (e.g., local labor
market conditions). To fully characterize the geography of intergenerational mobility, one would
ideally estimate all of the components of such a hierarchical model.
As a rst step toward this goal, we begin with a coarse partition and characterize intergenera
tional mobility at the level of commuting zones (CZs). CZs are aggregations of counties based on
commuting patterns in the 1990 Census constructed by Tolbert and Sizer (1996) and introduced
to the economics literature by Dorn (2009). Since CZs are designed to fully span the area in which
people live and work, they provide a natural starting point as the coarsest partition of areas. CZs
are similar to metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), but unlike MSAs, they cover the entire U.S.
(including rural areas). There are 741 CZs in the U.S.; on average, each CZ contains 4 counties
and has a population of 379,786. 17
We focus on CZlevel variation both for parsimony and because mobility statistics in narrower
neighborhoods may be more heavily aected by sorting within metro areas. Because property prices
are typically homogeneous within narrow areas and home values are highly correlated with parent
income, comparisons of individuals within a narrow neighborhood eectively condition on a proxy
for parent income. As a result, the variation in parent income across individuals in a narrow area
(such as a city block) must be correlated with other latent factors that may aect childrens out
comes directly, making it dicult to interpret the resulting mobility estimates. 18 Nevertheless, to
obtain some insight into withinCZ variation, we also report statistics on intergenerational mobility
by county in Online Data Table III. There is almost as much variance in intergenerational mobility
across counties within a CZ as there is across CZs, suggesting that the total amount of geographical
17See Online Appendix Figure II for an example of the Boston CZ. Note that CZs in urban areas generally have
much higher populations than rural CZs. To account for this variation, we always report statistics that restrict to
urban areas or use populationweights in addition to unweighted measures that pool all CZs.
18For example, it would be dicult to assess intergenerational mobility within midtown Manhattan because there
are very few lowincome individuals within this homogeneously highpropertyvalue area, and any families with low
observed income in such an area would have to be latently wealthy to be able to aord to live there. Although
the crossCZ dierences we document could certainly also be driven by dierences in latent characteristics across
individuals, we believe that understanding why mobility diers across these broader areas of the U.S. is of greater
descriptive interest than understanding variation across much narrower areas that is likely to be mechanically related
to dierences in property values.
18
variation may be even greater than that documented below. 19 We defer further analysis of such
withinCZ heterogeneity to future research.
We permanently assign each child to a single CZ based on the ZIP code from which his or her
parent led their tax return in the rst year the child was claimed as a dependent. We interpret
this CZ as the area where a child grew up. Because our data begin in 1996, location is measured
in 1996 for 95.9 of children in our core sample. For children in our core sample of 198082 birth
cohorts, we therefore typically measure location when children were approximately 15 years old.
For the children in the more recent birth cohorts in our extended sample, location is measured at
earlier ages. Using these more recent cohorts, we nd that 83.5 of children live in the same CZ
at age 16 as they did at age 5. Furthermore, we verify that the spatial patterns for the outcomes
we can measure at earlier ages (college attendance and teenage birth) are quite similar if we dene
CZs based on location at age 5 instead of age 16.
Importantly, the CZ where a child grew up does not necessarily correspond to the CZ she lives
in as an adult when we measure her income (at age 30) in 201112. In our core sample, 38 of
children live in a dierent CZ in 2012 relative to where they grew up.
IV.B Measures of Relative and Absolute Mobility
In our baseline analysis, we measure mobility at the CZ level using the core sample (198082
birth cohorts) and the denitions of parent and child family income described in Section III.A.
Importantly, we continue to rank both children and parents based on their positions in the national
income distribution (rather than the distribution within their CZ), using exactly the same ranks
as in Figure IIa.
We begin by examining the rankrank relationship in selected CZs. Figure Va presents a binned
scatter plot of the mean child rank vs. parent rank for children who grew up in the Salt Lake City,
UT (circles) or Charlotte, NC (triangles) commuting zones. The rankrank relationship is virtually
linear in both of these CZs, as at the national level. This linearity of the rankrank relationship is
a remarkably robust property across CZs, as illustrated for the 20 largest CZs in Online Appendix
Figure III.
Exploiting this approximate linearity, we summarize the conditional expectation of a childs
19The correlation between populationweighted CZlevel means of the countylevel mobility measures with the
CZlevel estimates of mobility exceeds 0.98, indicating that our approach does not suer from aggregation bias. To
further assess the robustness of our results to the geographical partition, we report statistics by MSA in Online Data
Table IV. For CZs that intersect MSAs, the correlation between CZlevel and MSAlevel mobility statistics exceeds
0.9.
19
rank given his parents rank in each CZ using two parameters: a slope and an intercept. Formally,
let yic denote the national income rank (among children in her birth cohort) of child i who grew
up in CZ c. Similarly, let xic denote her parents rank in the income distribution of parents in the
core sample. For each CZ c, we estimate a slope and intercept using an OLS regression of child
rank on parent rank in the microdata:
yic  c  cxic  ic (1)
Using the linear approximation to the rankrank relationship, let
ypc  c  cp (2)
denote the expected rank of a child whose parents national income rank is p in CZ c.20
One way to measure intergenerational mobility is to ask, What are the outcomes of children
from lowincome families relative to those of children from highincome families? This question
has been the focus of most prior research on intergenerational mobility (Solon 1999, Black et al.
2011).21 To answer this question, we dene the degree ofrelative mobility in CZ cas c, the slope of
the rankrank relationship. The dierence between the expected ranks of children born to parents
at the top and bottom of the income distribution is y100,c y0,c  100 c.
In Salt Lake City, c  0.264. The expected rank of children born to the richest parents
is y100 y0  26.4 percentiles above that of children born to the poorest parents. Charlotte
exhibits much less relative mobility (i.e., much greater persistence of income across generations).
In Charlotte, y100 y0  39.7.
A dierent way to measure intergenerational mobility is to ask, What are the outcomes of
children from families of a given income level in absolute terms? We dene absolute mobility
at percentile p in CZ c as ypc in (2). Given academic and public interest in the outcomes of
disadvantaged youth, we focus on average absolute mobility for children from families with below
median parent income (E[yicxic p  50,c]), which we term absolute upward mobility.22 Because
the rankrank relationship is linear, the average rank of children with belowmedian parent income
20We always measure percentile ranks on a 0100 scale and slopes on a 01 scale, so c ranges from 0100 and c
ranges from 0 to 1 in (2).
21Any measure of the extent to which parental income predicts childrens outcomes in a CZ is a measure of relative
mobility. In this sense, the traditional loglog IGE is a relative mobility measure, as it measures the dierence in
(log) outcomes between children of high vs. low income parents.
22We focus on the absolute outcomes of children from lowincome families both in the interest of space and because
there is more variation across areas in the outcomes of children from lowincome families than those from highincome
families, as we show in Figure VII below. However, the CZlevel statistics in Online Data Tables V and VI can be
used to analyze spatial variation in the outcomes of children from highincome families in future research.
20
equals the average rank of children with parents at the 25th percentile (y25,c  c25c), illustrated
by the dashed vertical line in Figure Va.
Absolute upward mobility is y25  46.2 in Salt Lake City, compared with y25  35.8 in Charlotte.
That is, among families earning 28,800  the 25th percentile of the national parent family income
distribution  children who grew up in Salt Lake City are on average 10 percentile points higher in
their birth cohorts income distribution at age 30 than children who grew up in Charlotte.
Absolute mobility is higher in Salt Lake City not just for belowmedian families, but at all
percentiles p of the parent income distribution. The gap in absolute outcomes is largest at the
bottom of the income distribution and nearly zero at the top. Hence, the greater relative mobility
in this particular comparison comes purely from better absolute outcomes at the bottom of the
distribution rather than worse outcomes at the top. Of course, this is not always the case. Figure Vb
shows that San Francisco has substantially higher relative mobility than Chicago: y100 y0  25.0
in San Francisco vs.  y100 y0  39.3 in Chicago. But part of the greater relative mobility in
San Francisco comes from worse outcomes for children from highincome families. Below the 60th
percentile, children in San Francisco have better outcomes than those in Chicago; above the 60th
percentile, the reverse is true.
The comparisons in Figure V illustrate the importance of measuring both relative and absolute
mobility. Any social welfare function based on mean income ranks that respects the Pareto principle
would rate Salt Lake City above Charlotte. But normative comparisons of San Francisco and
Chicago depend on the weight one puts on relative vs. absolute mobility (or, equivalently, on the
weights one places on absolute mobility at each percentile p).
IV.C Baseline Estimates by CZ
We estimate (1) using OLS to calculate absolute upward mobility (y25,c  c  25c) and relative
mobility (c) by CZ. The estimates for each CZ are reported in Online Data Table V.
Absolute Upward Mobility. Figure VIa presents a heat map of absolute upward mobility. We
construct this map by dividing CZs into deciles based on their estimated value of  y25,c. Lighter
colors represent deciles with higher levels of  y25,c.23 Upward mobility varies signicantly across
23We cannot estimate mobility for 32 CZs in which we have fewer than 250 children in the core sample, shown by
the crosshatched areas in the maps in Figure VI. These CZs account for less than 0.05 of the U.S. population in
the 2000 Census. In Online Appendix Figure IV, we present a version of this map in which we use data from the
198085 cohorts to estimate mobility for the CZs that have fewer than 250 observations in the core (198082) sample.
The estimates of mobility in the CZs with missing data are quite similar to those in neighboring CZs, consistent with
the spatial autocorrelation evident in the rest of the map.
21
areas. CZs in the top decile have  y25,c 52.0, while those in the bottom decile have y25,c 37.4.
Note that the 37th percentile of the family income distribution for children at age 30 is 22,900,
while the 52nd percentile is 35,500; hence, the dierence in upward mobility across areas translates
to substantial dierences in childrens incomes.
Pooling all CZs, the unweighted standard deviation (SD) of y25,c is 5.68; the populationweighted
SD is 3.34. The unconditional SD of childrens income ranks (which have a Uniform distribution) is
100
12  28.9. Hence, a 1 SD improvement in CZ quality  as measured by its level of absolute
upward mobility y25,c  is associated with a 5.6828.9  0.20 SD increase in the expected income
rank of children whose parents are at the 25th percentile. 24 For comparison, a 1 SD increase in
parent income rank is associated with a 0.34 SD increase in a childs income rank (Figure IIa).
Hence, a 1 SD improvement in CZ quality is associated with 60 as large an increase in a childs
income as a 1 SD increase in her own parents income.
There are three broad spatial patterns in upward mobility evident in Figure VIa. First, upward
mobility varies substantially at the regional level. Upward mobility is lowest in the Southeast and
highest in the Great Plains. The West Coast and Northeast also have high rates of upward mobility,
though not as high as the Great Plains.
Second, there is substantial withinregion variation as well. Using unweighted CZlevel regres
sions of the upward mobility estimates on Census division and state xed eects, we estimate that
53 of the crossCZ variance in absolute upward mobility is within the nine Census divisions and
36 is within states. For example, many parts of Texas exhibit relatively high rates of upward
mobility, unlike much of the rest of the South. Ohio exhibits much lower rates of upward mobility
than nearby Pennsylvania. The statistics also pick up much more granular variation in upward
mobility. For example, South Dakota generally exhibits very high levels of upward mobility, with
the exception of a few areas in the Southwest corner of the state. These areas are the largest Native
American reservations in the U.S. and are well known to suer from very high rates of persistent
poverty.
The third generic pattern is that urban areas tend to exhibit lower levels of intergenerational
mobility than rural areas on average. For instance, children from lowincome families who grow
24An analogous calculation using the estimates of college attendance gradients by CZ in Section V.A below implies
that a 1 SD increase in CZ quality is associated with a 0.19 SD (9.3 percentage point) increase in college attendance
rates for children with parents at the 25th percentile. Using data from the PSID, Solon, Page and Duncan (2002, p390)
estimate that a 1 SD increase in neighborhood quality is associated with a 0.32 SD increase in years of education.
We nd less variation in outcomes across neighborhoods presumably because commuting zones are much larger than
the PSID sampling clusters analyzed by Solon, Page, and Duncan.
22
up in the Chicago area have signicantly lower incomes at age 30 than those who grow up in rural
areas in Illinois. On average, urban areas  which we dene as CZs that intersect MSAs  have
upward mobility of y25,c  41.7, while rural areas have y25,c  45.8. In interpreting this comparison,
it is important to recall that our denition of geography is based on where children grew up, not
where they live as adults. 44.6 of children who grow up in rural areas live in urban areas at age
30. Among those who rose from the bottom quintile of the national income distribution to the top
quintile, the corresponding statistic is 55.2.
Table IV shows statistics on intergenerational mobility for the 50 largest CZs by population.
Among these cities, absolute upward mobility ranges from 46.2 in the Salt Lake City area to 35.8
in Charlotte (Column 4). There is considerable variation even between nearby cities: Pittsburgh
is ranked second in terms of upward mobility among large metro areas, while Cleveland  approxi
mately 100 miles away  is ranked in the bottom 10. Upward mobility is especially low in certain
cities in the Rust Belt such as Indianapolis and Columbus and cities in the Southeast such as
Atlanta and Raleigh. The fact that children who grow up in lowincome families in Atlanta and
Raleigh fare poorly is perhaps especially striking because these cities are generally considered to
be booming cities in the South with relatively high rates of job growth.
In Column 5 of Table IV, we consider an alternative measure of upward mobility: the probability
that a child born to a family in the bottom quintile of the national income distribution reaches the
top quintile of the national income distribution. To improve precision in smaller CZs, we estimate
this probability pooling the 19801985 birth cohorts. 25 The ranking of areas based on this statistic
is similar to that based on the mean rank measure of upward mobility. The probability that a
child from the lowest quintile of parental income rises to the top quintile ranges is 10.8 in Salt
Lake City, compared with 4.4 in Charlotte. The city with the highest probability of moving from
the bottom fth to the top fth is San Jose, where the probability (12.9) is nearly three times
that in Charlotte. Note that if parent income played no role in determining childrens outcomes,
all quintile transition probabilities would be 20. Hence, the variation in rates of upward mobility
across areas is large relative to the maximum range of 0 to 20.
Relative Mobility. Figure VIb presents a heat map of relative mobility. This map is constructed
25We verify that including more recent cohorts does not generate signicant bias by showing that the national
quintile transition matrix based on the 198085 cohorts (Online Appendix Table IV) is virtually identical to the
matrix based on the 198082 cohorts in Table III. The complete quintile transition matrix for each CZ is reported
in Online Data Table VI. Combined with the marginal distributions of parent and child income at the national level
(reported in Online Data Table II), the transition matrices can be used to construct any measure of intergenerational
mobility by CZ. For reference, we also provide statistics on the marginal distributions of parent and child income by
CZ in Online Data Table VII.
23
in the same way as Panel A, dividing CZs into deciles based on the rankrank slope c. In this map,
lighter areas denote areas with greater relative mobility (lower c). Relative mobility also varies
substantially across areas. The expected rank of children from the richest vs. poorest families diers
by more than 40.2 percentiles in CZs in the bottom decile of relative mobility. The corresponding
gap is less than 23.5 percentiles for CZs in the top decile.
The geographical patterns in relative mobility in Panel B are similar to those for absolute
upward mobility in Panel A. The unweighted correlation across CZs between the two measures is
0.68; the populationweighted correlation is 0.61. This indicates that areas with greater relative
mobility tend to have better absolute outcomes for children from lowincome families.
To investigate the connection between absolute and relative mobility more systematically, let
pc  E[yicxic  p,c] denote a childs expected rank given a parent rank of pin CZ c. We estimate
pc in each CZ nonparametrically as the mean value of yic for children in each percentile bin of
parent income p  0,..., 99.26 For each of the 100 values of p, we estimate an unweighted OLS
regression of pc on relative mobility c with one observation per CZ:
pc  a pc  pc.
In this equation, p measures the association across CZs between a 1 unit increase inc (i.e., greater
intergenerational persistence) and mean absolute outcomes of children whose parents were at the
pth percentile of the national income distribution. A negative coecient (p 0) implies that CZs
with greater relative mobility generate better mean outcomes for children with parents at percentile
p.
Figure VIIa plots the coecients p at each parent income percentile palong with a linear t to
the coecients. The coecients p are increasing with p: CZs with greater relative mobility (lower
c) produce better outcomes for children from lower income families. The best linear t crosses 0
at p 85.1. Hence, increases in relative mobility are associated with better outcomes for children
who grow up in families below the 85th percentile on average. For families at the 85th percentile,
dierences in relative mobility across CZs are uncorrelated with a childs mean rank. For families
in the top 15, living in a CZ with greater relative mobility is associated with worse outcomes
26The expected value pc diers from ypc dened above because pc is estimated nonparametrically using only
data in percentile bin p, whereas ypc is calculated based on the linear approximation to the rankrank relationship in
(2). In practice, the two estimates are extremely similar. For instance, in the 100 largest CZs, where pc is estimated
with very little error, the correlation between pc and ypc exceeds 0.99. We use the linear approximation ypc in most
of our analysis to obtain more precise estimates of absolute mobility in smaller CZs. However, because the goal of
the exercise here is to evaluate the relationship between relative mobility c and absolute mobility at each percentile
nonparametrically, we use pc here.
24
on average for children. Observe that p reaches only 0.2 for the richest families but is nearly
0.8 for the poorest families. Hence, dierences in relative mobility across CZs are associated with
much larger dierences in absolute mobility for children from lowincome families than highincome
families.27
Figure VIIb presents a schematic that illustrates the intuition underlying the preceding results.
This gure plots hypothetical rankrank relationships in two representative CZs, one of which has
more relative mobility than the other. Figure VIIa implies that in such a pairwise comparison, the
rankrank relationship pivots at the 85th percentile on average. This is why the spatial patterns
of absolute mobility at p 25 and relative mobility in Figure VI look similar.
Because the pivot point is very high in the income distribution, dierences in relative mobility
have a smaller eect on childrens percentile ranks in highincome families than lowincome fami
lies.28 This may be because the rich are able to insulate themselves from dierences in the local
environment. If the dierences in relative mobility across areas are caused by dierences in local
policies, this result suggests that one may be able to improve the outcomes of children from poor
families without hurting children from high income families signicantly.
IV.D Robustness of Spatial Patterns
In Table V, we assess the robustness of the spatial patterns in mobility documented above along
three dimensions: (1) changes in sample denitions, (2) changes in income measures, and (3)
adjustments for factors such as dierences in the costofliving across areas. Each cell in the table
reports the correlation across CZs of our baseline mobility measure (using child family income rank
and parent family income rank in the core sample) with an alternative mobility measure described
in each row. Column 1 reports the unweighted correlation across CZs between our baseline measure
of absolute upward mobility (y25,c) and the corresponding alternative measure of  y25,c. Column
2 replicates Column 1 for relative mobility ( c). Columns 3 and 4 replicate the correlations in
Columns 1 and 2 weighting CZs by their population in the 2000 Census.
Sample Denitions. In the rst section of Table V, we assess the robustness of the spatial
27If the rankrank relationship were perfectly linear, the relationship plotted in Figure VIIa would be perfectly
linear and 100  0  1 mechanically. The slight deviation from linearity at the bottom of the distribution evident
in Figure V generates the slight deviation of 100  0 from 1.
28It bears emphasis that this result applies to percentile ranks rather than mean income levels. Because the income
distribution has a thick upper tail, a given dierence in percentile ranks translates to a much larger dierence in
mean incomes in the upper tail of the income distribution. The probability that children of auent parents become
very high income superstars may therefore dier signicantly across areas, an interesting question that we defer to
future research.
25
patterns to changes in the sample denition, as we did at the national level in Table II. Rows 1
and 2 restrict the sample to male and female children, respectively. Rows 3 and 4 consider the
subsamples of married parents and single parents. The correlations of both absolute and relative
mobility in these subsamples with the corresponding baseline measures is typically above 0.9.
In row 5, we replicate the baseline specications using the 198385 birth cohorts (whose incomes
are measured at age 27 on average in 201112). In row 6, we consider the 198688 birth cohorts
instead. The intergenerational mobility estimates across CZs for these later birth cohorts are
very highly correlated with the baseline estimates. This result has three implications. First, it
demonstrates that the reliability of CZlevel estimates is quite high across cohorts; in particular,
sampling error or cohortspecic shocks do not lead to much uctuation in the CZlevel estimates.
Second, because the later cohorts are linked to parents at earlier ages (as early as age 8), we
conclude that the spatial patterns in intergenerational mobility are not sensitive to the precise age
at which we link children to parents or measure their geographical location. Finally, because the
earnings of later cohorts are measured at earlier ages, we conclude that one can detect the spatial
dierences in mobility even when measuring earnings quite early in childrens careers.
In row 7, we restrict the sample based on the age of parents at the birth of the child. We limit
the sample to children whose mothers are between the ages of 2428 and fathers are between 2630
(a ve year window around the median age of birth). The intergenerational mobility estimates in
this subsample are very highly correlated with the baseline estimates, indicating that the crossarea
dierences in income mobility are not biased by dierences in the age of child birth for low income
individuals.
In row 8, we assess the extent to which the variation in intergenerational mobility comes from
children who succeed and move out of the CZ as adults vs. children who stay within the CZ. To
do so, we restrict the sample to the 62 of children who live in the same CZ in 2012 as where
they grew up. Despite the fact that this sample is endogenously selected on an expost outcome,
the mobility estimates remain very highly correlated with those in the full sample. Apparently,
areas such as Salt Lake City that generate high levels of upward income mobility do so not just
by sending successful children to other CZs as adults but also by helping children move up in the
income distribution within the area.
In row 9, we restrict the sample to the 88 of children in the core sample who are not claimed
as dependents by other individuals in subsequent years after they are linked to the parents we
identify. We obtain very similar estimates for this unique parent subsample, indicating that the
26
spatial pattern of our mobility estimates is not distorted by measurement error in linking children
to their parents.
Income Denitions. In the second section of Table V, we evaluate the sensitivity of the spatial
patterns to alternative denitions of income. The denitions we consider match those in the
robustness analysis in Table II; see Section II.B for details on these denitions. In row 10 of
Table V, we dene parent income as the income of the higher earner rather than total family
income to evaluate potential biases from dierences in parent marital status across areas. In row
11, we measure the childs income using individual income instead of family income to assess the
eects of dierences in the childs marital status. In row 12, we use the childs individual earnings
(excluding capital and other nonlabor income). In row 13, we replicate the specication in row 8
for male children, using individual income for the child and family income for the parent. Row 14
replicates row 13, but denes the parents income as the income of the higher earner instead. All
of these denitions produce very similar spatial patterns in intergenerational mobility: correlations
with the baseline measures exceed 0.9 in most cases.
CostofLiving, Local Growth, and Other Factors. The third section of Table V considers a set
of other factors that could bias comparisons of intergenerational mobility across areas. One natural
concern is that our estimates of upward mobility may be aected by dierences in prices across
areas. To evaluate the importance of dierences in cost of living, we construct a CZlevel price
index using the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA) price index for
urban areas combined with information on housing values, population density, and CZ location
(see Online Appendix A for details). We then divide parents income by the price index for the CZ
where their child grew up and the childs income by the price index for the CZ where she lives as
an adult (in 2012) to obtain real income measures.
Row 15 of Table V shows that the measures of intergenerational mobility based on real incomes
are very highly correlated with our baseline measures (see also Online Appendix Figure Va). The
reason that costofliving adjustments have little eect is that prices aect both the parent and
the child. Intuitively, in highpriced areas such as New York City, adjusting for prices reduces the
childs absolute rank in the national real income distribution. But adjusting for prices also lowers
the real income rank of parents living in New York City. As a result, the degree of upward mobility
i.e., the dierence between the childs rank and the parents rank  is essentially unaected by
adjusting for local prices. The preceding logic assumes that children always live in the same cities
in their parents. In practice, some children move to areas with higher prices (e.g. from rural Iowa
27
to New York City). Our measures of upward mobility are aected by the cost of living adjustment
in such cases, but they are not suciently frequent to have a large impact on our estimates. The
correlation between the cost of living in the childs CZ at age 30 and the parents CZ is 0.77 and the
correlation between a childs nominal percentile rank and the local price index is only 0.10. Because
of these two factors, cost of living adjustments end up having a minor impact on the dierence
between child and parent income and thus have little eect on our mobility statistics.
Another potential concern with our approach is that using national ranks may misrepresent the
degree of relative mobility within the local income distribution, which may better reect a childs
opportunities. To address this concern, in row 16 of Table V, we measure relative mobility using
local ranks. We rank parents relative to other parents living in the same CZ and children relative
to other children who grew up in the same CZ (no matter where they live as adults). We dene
relative mobility as the slope of the local rankrank relationship.29 Relative mobility based on local
ranks is very highly correlated with relative mobility based on national ranks. This is because local
ranks are approximately a linear transformation of national ranks.
In row 17, we measure absolute upward mobility based on the probability that the child rises
from the bottom quintile of parent income to the top quintile of child income, as in Column 5 of
Table IV. The spatial pattern in this measure  shown in the map in Online Appendix Figure Vb
is very similar to that in our meanrank based measure of upward mobility, with a correlation
across CZs above 0.9.
Part of the variation in upward mobility across areas could be driven by shocks to economic
growth. Because we measure parent income before 2000 and child income in 201112, local economic
growth in the intervening decade would lead the child to be ranked higher in the national income
distribution than the parent. While shocks to economic growth  e.g., from the discovery of a
natural resource such as oil  are a real source of upward mobility, one may be interested in
isolating variation in mobility that is attributable to more stable factors that may be manipulable
by policy. We assess the extent to which economic growth is responsible for the spatial variation
in upward mobility in two ways. In row 18, we dene parent income as mean family income in
201112, the same years in which we measure child income. Insofar as local economic growth raises
the incomes of both parents and children, this measure nets out the eects of growth on mobility.
Both the upward and relative mobility measures remain very highly correlated with the baseline
29We cannot study absolute mobility with local ranks because both child and parent ranks have a mean of 50 by
denition: if one child moves up in the local distribution, another must move down.
28
measures, suggesting that dierences in local economic growth drive relatively little of the spatial
variation in mobility.
One limitation of using parent income in 201112 to net out growth eects is that growth shocks
may have bigger eects on younger workers who are just entering the labor force. As an alternative
approach, we regress our measures of mobility on the CZlevel growth rate from 20002010 and
calculate residuals.30 Row 19 of Table V shows that the correlation of the growthadjusted relative
mobility measures with the baseline measures exceeds 0.9; the correlations for absolute mobility
exceed 0.8. Note that these growthadjusted measures overcontrol for exogenous growth shocks
insofar as growth is partly a consequence of factors that generate upward income mobility in an
area. Hence, the fact that even controlling for growth rates directly does not signicantly change
the spatial pattern of intergenerational mobility supports the view that most of the variation in
mobility across areas is not due to exogenous growth shocks in the 2000s.
IV.E College Attendance and Teenage Birth Gradients
In Figure VIII, we explore the geographical variation in the gradients of college attendance rates
and teenage birth rates with respect to parent income, which we plotted at the national level in
Figure IV. To construct Figure VIIIa, we regress college attendance on parent national income rank
in each CZ c. We use the same specication as in (1), replacing the dependent variable with an
indicator for attending college at some point between the ages of 1821. The map plots the slope
from these regressions in each CZ, dividing the CZs into deciles (with darker colors representing
areas with steeper slopes), as in Figure VIa.
There is substantial variation across CZs in the association between parent income and childrens
college attendance rates. CZs in the top decile of collegeincome gradients have c  0.8, i.e.
children of the highest income parents are 80 percentage points more likely to attend college than
children of the lowest income parents. CZs in the bottom decile have c  0.53. Moreover,
the spatial variation in collegeincome gradients is highly correlated with the spatial variation in
the intergenerational income mobility. 31 The unweighted correlation across CZs of the gradients
30We measure income in 2000 using the Census and in 2008 using the 5year American Community Survey, averaged
over 20062010. We calculate household income per working age adult as aggregate income in a CZ divided by the
number of individuals aged 1664 in that CZ. Annualized income growth is calculated as the annual growth rate
implied by the change in income over the 8 year period; we use 8 years because 2008 is the midpoint of 20062010.
31As above, we dene absolute mobility for the college outcome as the mean college attendance rate for children
whose parents are at the 25th percentile, based on the linear regression of college attendance on parent rank. As with
earnings, areas with atter college by parent income gradients (i.e., greater relative mobility) tend to have higher
college attendance rates for lower income children (i.e., greater absolute upward mobility). The slopes of the college
and teenage birth gradients and absolute mobility measures for each CZ are reported in Online Data Table V.
29
in Figure VIIIa with the corresponding relative mobility measures based on childrens income in
Figure VIa is  0.68 (row 20 of Table V).
Figure VIIIb repeats the analysis in Figure VIIIa using an indicator for having a teenage birth,
dened as in Figure IVb. In this gure, we restrict the sample to females. CZs in the bottom decile
(those with the steepest negative gradients) have c  0.37. That is, daughters of the lowest
income parents are 37 percentage points more likely to have a child while they are teenagers than
daughters of the highest income parents. CZs in the top decile have c 0.18. Once again, this
spatial variation is quite highly correlated with the variation in intergenerational earnings mobility
(row 21 of Table V).
An important implication of these results is that much of the dierence in intergenerational
mobility across areas emerges before children enter the labor market. 32 This suggests that the
spatial variation in income mobility is driven by factors that either directly aect children at
early ages  e.g., the quality of schools or social structure  or anticipatory behavioral responses
to subsequent dierences, such as returns to education in the local labor market. We explore
mechanisms that have such properties in the next section.
V Correlates of Intergenerational Mobility
Why do some areas of the U.S. exhibit much higher rates of upward mobility than others? As a rst
step toward answering this question, we correlate our measures of intergenerational mobility with
local area characteristics. Naturally, such correlations cannot be interpreted as causal mechanisms.
Our goal here is merely to document a set of stylized facts that we hope will be helpful in guiding
the search for causal determinants and the development of new models of intergenerational mobility.
We organize our analysis of such mechanisms around a set of factors that have been discussed in
the sociology and economics literature: (1) race, (2) segregation, (3) income levels and inequality,
(4) local public goods and tax policies, (5) primary school quality, (6) access to higher education,
(7) local labor market conditions, (8) migration and networks, (9) social capital, and (10) family
structure.
Because most of these factors are slowmoving and we have estimates of intergenerational income
mobility for essentially one birth cohort, we focus on crosssectional correlations rather than changes
32The fact that college and teenage birth gradients are similar to income mobility gradients provides further evidence
that growth shocks in the 2000s do not generate the dierences in mobility across areas, as college and teenage birth
are measured around 2000. These results also show that the spatial patterns are unlikely to be driven by dierences
in reporting of taxable income.
30
over time. For most covariates, we use data from the 2000 Census and other publicly available
datasets because many variables cannot be consistently measured in earlier years. We verify that
results are similar using data from 1990 for selected variables. See Online Appendix D for details on
the construction of the covariates analyzed in this section and Online Data Table VIII for CZlevel
data on each of the covariates.
V.A Race
Perhaps the most obvious pattern from the maps in Figure VI is that intergenerational mobility
is lower in areas with larger AfricanAmerican populations, such as the Southeast. We therefore
begin by exploring the role of race in upward mobility. Throughout our analysis of correlations, we
focus primarily on our baseline measure of absolute upward mobility ( y25,c). Correlations of area
characteristics with relative mobility are similar, which is to be expected since absolute upward
mobility and relative mobility are themselves highly correlated as shown above.
Figure IXa presents a binned scatter plot of absolute upward mobility ( y25,c) in each CZ vs.
the fraction of black individuals living in that CZ, based on data from the 2000 Census. The
gure is constructed using one observation for each of the 709 CZs for which we have more than
250 parentchild pairs. To construct the binned scatter plot, we divide the variable plotted on the
xaxis ( black in the CZ) into 20 equally sized bins (vingtiles) and plot the mean value of the
variable plotted on the yaxis (absolute upward mobility) vs. the mean value of the x variable
within each bin. We also report the unweighted correlation between the x and y variables, with
standard error clustered at the state level to correct for spatial correlation across CZs. To facilitate
comparisons across gures that plot the relationship between upward mobility and dierent factors,
we always use a xed y scale ranging from 35 to 55, approximately the 5th to 95th percentile of
the distribution of y25,c across CZs.
Figure IXa conrms that areas with larger AfricanAmerican populations do in fact have sub
stantially lower rates of upward mobility. The correlation between upward mobility and fraction
black is 0.585. In areas that have small black populations, children born to parents at the 25th per
centile can expect to reach the median of the national income distribution on average (y25,c  50);
in areas with large AfricanAmerican populations, y25,c is only 35.
The correlation in Figure IXa could be driven by two very dierent channels. One channel is an
individuallevel race eect: black children may have lower incomes than white children conditional
on parent income, and hence areas with a larger black population may have lower upward mobility.
31
An alternative possibility is a placelevel race eect: areas with large black populations might have
lower rates of upward mobility for children of all races. To distinguish between these two channels,
one would ideally control for race at the individual level, essentially asking whether whites have
lower rates of upward mobility in areas with a larger black population.
Unfortunately, we do not observe race in our data. As an alternative, we predict race based on
the parents 5digit ZIP code (in the year they rst claim their child as a dependent). We use data
from the 2000 Census to measure racial shares by ZIP code. Figure IXb replicates our measures
of absolute upward mobility (y25,c) by CZ, restricting the sample to ZIP codes within each CZ in
which at least 80 of the residents are nonhispanic whites.33 In this subsample, 91 of individuals
are white. The spatial pattern in Figure IXb is very similar to that in the original map for the
full sample in Figure VIa. Most notably, even in this predominantly white sample, rates of upward
mobility remain low in the Southeast and are much higher in the West. Among the 604 CZs for
which we are able to compute upward mobility measures for predominantly white individuals, the
unweighted correlation between upward mobility for the predominantly white sample and the full
sample is 0.91.
In Figure IXc, we generalize this approach to assess how the spatial pattern of upward mobility
changes as we restrict the sample to be increasingly white. To construct this gure, we rst
compute upward mobility in each CZ, restricting the sample to individuals living in ZIP codes that
are more than w white, which we denote by  yw
25,c. We then regress  yw
25,c on y25,c, our baseline
estimates of upward mobility based on the full sample, using an unweighted OLS regression with
one observation per CZ with available data. We vary w from 0 to 95 in increments of 5
and plot the resulting regression coecients in Figure IXc against the fraction of white individuals
in each of the subsamples. When w  0, the regression coecient is 1 by construction because
y25,c  yw0
25,c . Since 75 of the U.S. population is white, the rst point on the gure is (0.75,
1). The point generated by the w  80 threshold is (0.91, 0.84), consistent with the map in
Figure IXb. The dotted lines show a 95 condence interval for the regression coecients based
on standard errors clustered at the state level.
If the variation in upward mobility across areas were entirely driven by heterogeneity in outcomes
across race at the individual level, the coecient in Figure IXc would fall to zero as the fraction
33We continue to estimate y25,c at the CZ level in this map, but we only include ZIP5s within each CZ in which
80 or more of the residents are white. To facilitate comparison to Figure VI, we color the entire CZ based on this
statistic, including ZIP5s whose own white share is below 80. CZs that have fewer than 250 children who grew
up in ZIP codes where more than 80 of the residents are white are omitted (and shown with crosshatch shading).
32
white in the sample converged to 1, as illustrated by the dashed line. Intuitively, if all of the spatial
variation in Figure VIa were driven by individuallevel dierences in race, there would be no spatial
variation left in a purely white sample. The data reject this hypothesis: even in the subsample
with more than 95 white individuals, the regression coecient remains at 0.89.
The main lesson of the analysis in this section is that both blacks and whites living in areas
with large AfricanAmerican populations have lower rates of upward income mobility. One potential
mechanism for this pattern is the historical legacy of greater segregation in areas with more blacks.
Such segregation could potentially aect both lowincome whites and blacks, as racial segregation
is often associated with income segregation. We turn to the relationship between segregation and
upward mobility in the next section.
V.B Segregation
Prior work has argued that segregation has negative eects on economic and social outcomes
through various channels: reducing exposure to successful peers and role models, decreasing funding
for local public goods such as schools, or hampering access to nearby jobs (Wilson 1987, Massey and
Denton 1993, Cutler and Glaeser 1997). Motivated by these theories, we explore the relationship
between intergenerational mobility and various measures of segregation.
We begin by estimating the association between racial segregation and upward mobility. Fol
lowing Iceland (2004), we measure segregation using a Theil (1972) index, constructed using data
from the 2000 Census. 34 Let pr denote the fraction of individuals of race r in a given CZ, with
four racial groups: whites, blacks, hispanics, and others. We measure the level of racial diver
sity in the CZ by an entropy index: E  pr log2
1
pr , with prlog2
1
pr  0 when pr  0. Letting
j  1,...,N index census tracts in the CZ, we analogously measure racial diversity within each
tract as Ej  prj log2
1
prj
where prj denotes the fraction of individuals of race r in tract j. We
dene the degree of racial segregation in the CZ as
H
j
[ popj
poptotal
EEj
E ] (3)
34As Iceland (2004) argues, the Theil index is an attractive measure conceptually because it captures segregation
across multiple racial groups. However, we obtain similar results using alternative twogroup measures of blackwhite
segregation such as isolation indices or dissimilarity indices because alternative measures of segregation are highly
correlated at the level of metro areas (Cutler et al. 1999). The segregation patterns are suciently stark that one can
directly see the dierences in segregation between the least and most upwardly mobile cities using the colorcoded dot
maps produced by Cable (2013) using Census data. For instance, compare Atlanta  one of the most segregated cities
and one of the lowestmobility cities in our data  to Sacramento  one of the most integrated and highestmobility
cities.
33
where pop j denotes the total population of tract j and pop total denotes the total population of
the CZ. Intuitively, H measures the extent to which the racial distribution in each Census tract
deviates from the overall racial distribution in the CZ. The segregation index H is maximized at
H  1 when there is no racial heterogeneity within census tracts, in which case Ej  0 in all tracts.
It is minimized at H(p)  0 when racial diversity within each tract  as measured by entropy Ej
is the same across all tracts.
Column 1 of Table VI reports the coecient estimate from an unweighted OLS regression of
absolute upward mobility y25,c on the racial segregation index, with one observation per CZ. In
this and all subsequent regressions in this paper, we standardize the dependent variable and all
independent variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 within the estimation sample.
Hence, the coecients in the univariate regressions can be interpreted as correlation coecients.
Standard errors are clustered by state to account for spatial correlation across CZs.
More racially segregated areas have less upward mobility: the unweighted correlation between
upward mobility and the racial segregation index in Column 1 is 0.361. See Online Appendix
Figure VIa for the corresponding nonparametric binned scatter plot. Column 2 shows that the
correlation remains at 0.360 in urban areas, i.e. CZs that overlap with metropolitan statistical
areas (MSAs).
Next, we turn to the relationship between income segregation and upward mobility. Following
Reardon and Firebaugh (2002) and Reardon (2011), we begin by measuring the degree to which
individuals below the pth percentile of the local household income distribution are segregated from
individuals above the pth percentile in each CZ using a twogroup Theil index H(p). Here, entropy
in a given area is E(p)  plog2
1
p  (1p) log2
1
1p and the index H(p) is dened using the formula
in (3). Building on this measure, Reardon (2011) denes the overall level of income segregation in
a given CZ as
income segregation  2 log(2)
p E(p)H(p)dp. (4)
This measure is simply a weighted average of segregation at each percentile p, with greater weight
placed on percentiles in the middle of the income distribution, where entropy E(p) is maximized.
We implement (4) using data from the 2000 Census, which reports income binned in 16 categories.
Following Reardon (2011, Appendix 3), we measure H(p) at each of these cutos and take a
weighted sum of these values to calculate income segregation.
In Column 3 of Table VI, we regress absolute upward mobility on the income segregation index;
see Online Appendix Figure VIb for the corresponding nonparametric binned scatter plot. The
34
correlation between income segregation and upward mobility is 0.393. Interestingly, areas with a
larger black population exhibit greater income segregation: the correlation between the fraction
of black individuals in a CZ and the income segregation index is 0.271 (s.e. 0.077). Hence, the
negative relationship between income segregation and upward mobility could partly explain why
lowincome white children fare more poorly in areas with large AfricanAmerican populations.
In Column 4, we decompose the eects of segregation in dierent parts of the income distribu
tion. Following Reardon and Bischo (2011), we dene the segregation of poverty as H(p 25),
i.e. the extent to which individuals in the bottom quartile are segregated from those above the
25th percentile. We analogously dene the segregation of auence as H(p 75). Conditional on
the degree of segregation of auence, segregation of poverty is strongly negatively correlated with
upward mobility. However, there is no signicant relationship between the segregation of auence
and upward mobility conditional on segregation of poverty. Column 5 shows that the same pattern
holds when restricting the sample to urban areas.
These results suggest that it is the isolation of lowincome families rather than the isolation
of the rich that may be most detrimental for low income childrens prospects of moving up in the
income distribution. One explanation of this correlation is that the separation of the middle class
from the poor reduces benecial peer eects or funding for local public goods (e.g., schools) for
children from lowincome families. In contrast, the separation of the auent from the middle class
may not directly harm low income individuals.
Another mechanism by which segregation may diminish upward mobility is through spatial
mismatch in access to jobs (Kain 1968, Kasarda 1989, Wilson 1996). We explore this mechanism in
Column 6 by correlating upward mobility with the fraction of individuals who commute less than
15 minutes to work in the CZ, based on data from the 2000 Census. Areas with less sprawl (shorter
commutes) have signicantly higher rates of upward mobility: the correlation between commute
times and upward mobility is 0.6, higher than the univariate correlation with any of the measures
of segregation.
In Column 7, we regress upward mobility on both the commute time variable and income seg
regation. Commute times remain strongly associated with upward mobility conditional on income
segregation, but income segregation is not signicantly correlated with upward mobility once we
condition on commute times. These results are consistent with the view that the negative impacts
of segregation may operate by making it more dicult to reach jobs or other resources that fa
cilitate upward mobility. Note that any such spatial mismatch explanation must explain why the
35
gradients emerge before children enter the labor market, as shown in Section IV.E. A lack of access
to nearby jobs cannot directly explain why children from lowincome families are also more likely
to have teenage births and less likely to attend college in cities with low levels of upward mobility.
However, spatial mismatch could produce such patterns if it changes childrens behavior because
they have fewer successful role models or reduces their perceived returns to education.
We summarize our results on segregation in the rst panel of Figure X. Figure X plots the
unweighted univariate correlation between absolute upward mobility and various CZlevel char
acteristics, using all CZs with available data for the relevant variable. The dots show the point
estimate of the correlation and the horizontal lines show a 95 condence interval, based on stan
dard errors clustered at the state level. The sign of the correlation is shown in parentheses next to
each variable.
Table VII reports each of the correlations corresponding to Figure X in Column 1 and evaluates
their robustness to alternative specications in the other columns. In Column 2, we report estimates
based on withinstate variation by including state xed eects in a regression specication analogous
to that in Column 1 of Table VI. Column 3 replicates Column 1, weighting each CZ by its population
as recorded in the 2000 Census.35 Column 4 restricts the sample to urban areas (CZs that intersect
MSAs) and replicates Column 1. Column 5 replicates Column 1, controlling for the fraction of black
individuals in the CZ and the local income growth rate from 20002010 (calculated as in Section
IV.D using Census data) using regression specications of the form used in Table VI. Finally, in
Column 6, we correlate each covariate with relative mobility c.
We nd a signicant negative correlation between upward income mobility and each of our
three primary proxies for segregation  racial segregation, income segregation, and commute times
across all the specications in Table VII. 36 Importantly, this correlation holds even within states
(Column 2), showing that the pattern is not just driven by broad regional dierences across the
South vs. other parts of the country. Segregation is also strongly negatively correlated with relative
mobility (i.e., positively correlated with c).
35We normalize all variables by their weighted standard deviations in this and all other specications that use
weights, so that univariate regression coecients can be interpreted as weighted correlations.
36We also replicated this analysis using measures of segregation from the 1990 Census and nd very similar results.
For example, the correlation between upward mobility and the Theil racial segregation index measured using the
1990 Census is 0.357, compared with 0.361 when measured using the 2000 Census. The correlation between upward
mobility and income segregation is 0.393 using both the 1990 and 2000 Census.
36
V.C Income Levels and Inequality
Several studies have proposed that there may be a link between properties of the static income dis
tribution  for instance, levels of inequality within a generation  and the level of intergenerational
mobility (e.g., Corak 2013). In this subsection, we explore the correlation between properties of
the local income distribution and upward income mobility.
Mean Income Levels. Figure XIa presents a binned scatter plot of absolute upward mobility
vs. the mean level of household income per working age adult in the CZ, as measured in the 2000
Census.37 There is little relationship between mean CZlevel income and upward mobility. Children
in lowincome families who grow up in the highestincome CZs (with mean incomes of 47,600 per
year) reach almost exactly the same percentile of the national income distribution on average as
those who grow up in the lowestincome areas (with mean incomes of 21,900).
The result in Figure XIa stands in contrast with the results on income segregation above, which
eectively shows that lowincome children who grow up in census tracts with higher levels of mean
income have better outcomes. This may be because peer eects and the provision of public goods
operate at a narrow geographic level. Living in a higher income metro area might not benet
lowincome children if it has no eect on their peer group or resources due to income segregation
within the CZ.
Income Inequality. Figure XIb presents a binned scatter plot of upward mobility vs. the Gini
coecient of parent income within each CZ. We compute the Gini coecient for parents in our
core sample within each CZ as Gini  2
zc Cov(zic,xic), where zc is the mean family income (from
19962000) of parents in CZ c and Cov(zic,xic) is the covariance between the income level ( zic)
and the percentile rank ( xic) of parents in CZ c. The correlation between the Gini coecient and
upward mobility is 0.578, implying that there is a Great Gatsby relationship within the U.S.
similar to that documented across countries in prior work.
An alternative measure of inequality is the portion of income within a CZ that accrues to the
richest households, e.g. those in the top 1. This measure is of particular interest because the rise
in inequality in the U.S. over the past three decades was driven primarily by an increase in top
income shares (Piketty and Saez 2003). We calculate top 1 income shares using the distribution
of parent family income within each CZ. Figure XIc shows that the relationship between upward
mobility and the top 1 income share is much weaker (correlation  0.190).
37We nd similar results using mean income in 1990; however, we nd a positive correlation with mean income in
2010, reecting the correlation with income growth documented above.
37
We investigate why the Gini coecient and top 1 share produce dierent results in Table VIII,
which is constructed in the same way as Table VI. Column 1 replicates the regression corresponding
to Figure XIb as a reference. We decompose the Gini coecient into inequality coming from the
upper tail and the rest of the income distribution by dening the bottom 99 Gini as the Gini
coecient minus the top 1 income share. The bottom 99 Gini can be interpreted as the deviation
of the Lorenz curve from perfect equality amongst households in the bottom 99. Column 2 of
Table VIII shows that a 1 SD increase in the bottom 99 Gini is associated with a 0.634 SD
reduction in upward mobility. In contrast, a 1 SD increase in the top 1 share is associated with
only a 0.123 SD reduction in upward mobility. Column 3 replicates Column 2 for urban areas (CZs
that overlap with MSAs). The pattern in urban areas is even more stark: upper tail inequality is
uncorrelated with upward mobility, whereas the Gini coecient within the bottom 99 remains
very highly strongly correlated with upward mobility.
An alternative and perhaps more intuitive measure of inequality within the bottom 99 is the
size of the middle class in the CZ, which we dene as the fraction of parents in the CZ who have
family incomes between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the national parent income distribution.
Column 4 of Table VIII shows that upward mobility is strongly positively correlated with the size
of the middle class.
Finally, Column 5 of Table VIII replicates Column 2 using relative mobilityc as the dependent
variable. The bottom 99 Gini coecient is strongly positively associated with this measure, i.e.
greater inequality in the bottom 99 is negatively related to relative mobility. 38 But once again,
the top 1 share is uncorrelated with relative mobility.
We summarize our results on properties of the income distribution and evaluate their robustness
in the second panel of Table VII and Figure X. Across all the specications, we nd (1) little
association between mean income levels and mobility, (2) a robust negative relationship between
the bottom 99 Gini coecient and mobility, and (3) little relationship between the top 1 share
and mobility.
Comparison to CrossCountry Evidence. The preceding analysis shows that the correlation
between inequality and intergenerational mobility across areas within the U.S. is driven primarily
by middle class inequality  i.e., inequality within the bottom 99  rather than the concen
tration of income in the upper tail. Is this also the case with the original Great Gatsby curve
38Importantly, because parent and child ranks are measured in the national income distribution, there is no me
chanical relationship between the level of inequality within the CZs income distribution and the rankrank slope.
38
documented by Corak (2006, 2013) across countries? We answer this question using estimates of
the intergenerational elasticity (IGE) from 13 developed countries compiled by Corak (2013). In
Column 6 of Table VIII, we replicate Coraks (2013, Figure 1) result that there is a strong positive
correlation between the Gini coecient (as measured in survey data on income in 1985) and the
IGE.39 In Column 7, we include the top 1 income share in each country, based on statistics from
the World Top Incomes Database. As in the withinU.S. analysis, there is little correlation between
the top 1 income share and intergenerational mobility across countries. Column 8 shows that
results are similar if one uses inequality measures from 2005 instead of 1985.
We conclude that there is a robust negative correlation between inequality within the current
generation of adults and mobility across generations. However, intergenerational mobility is pri
marily correlated with middleclass inequality and not the extreme upper tail inequality of the
form that has increased dramatically in recent decades. Interestingly, this pattern parallels the
results we obtained for segregation above: segregation of auence is not signicantly correlated
with intergenerational mobility, while segregation of poverty (the separation of the poor from the
middle class) is strongly negative associated with mobility.
V.D Local Public Goods and Tax Policies
Economic models of intergenerational mobility predict that the provision of local public goods or
tax credits to low income families can relax credit constraints and increase mobility (e.g., Becker
and Tomes 1979, Becker and Tomes 1986, Mulligan 1997, Ichino et al. 2011). In this subsection,
we assess whether variation in local tax and expenditure policies explain the geographical variation
in mobility. We report these results in the third panel of Figure X and Table VII.
We begin by correlating upward mobility with local tax rates. We measure the average local
tax rate in each CZ as total tax revenue collected at the county or lower level in the CZ (based
on the 1992 Census of Governments) divided by total household income in the CZ based on the
1990 Census.40 Note that 75 of local tax revenue comes from property taxes; hence, this measure
largely captures variation in property tax rates. In the baseline unweighted specication pooling all
39We interpret Coraks estimates of the Gini coecient as measures that apply to the bottom 99 because surveys
typically do not capture the thickness of the top tail due to topcoding.
40Government expenditures in the neighborhoods where lowincome families live within the CZ (rather than average
government expenditures) may be more relevant for upward mobility. To evaluate this possibility, we reconstructed
each of the measures of public goods and school quality analyzed in this and the next subsection, weighting by the
number of belowmedian income families living in each county or school district. The correlations between upward
mobility and these measures of public goods for lowincome individuals are very similar to those reported in Table
VII because expenditures in lowincome areas are very highly correlated with mean expenditures at the CZ level.
39
CZs, the correlation between absolute upward mobility is 0.32. We nd a robust positive correlation
between tax rates and upward mobility across the specications in Table VII. 41
An alternative measure of local public good provision is total local government expenditure.
Tax revenue diers from local government expenditure because of intergovernmental transfers. We
dene mean local government expenditure as total expenditure at the county or lower level divided
by household income in the CZ in 1990. The correlation between government expenditure and
upward mobility is also positive, but it is smaller than that between local tax rates and upward
mobility. This could potentially be because local tax rates are used primarily to nance schools,
which may have a larger impact on upward mobility than expenditures funded by other sources of
revenue.
Next, we evaluate whether areas that provide more transfers to lowincome families through the
tax system exhibit greater upward mobility. We use two statelevel proxies for the progressivity of
local tax policy. The rst is the size of the state Earned Income Tax Credit. State EITC programs
are the largest statelevel cash transfer for low income earners. Because state EITC policies changed
signicantly over the period when children in our sample were growing up, we dene a measure
of mean exposure to the state EITC as the mean state EITC rate between 1981 and 2001, when
the children in our sample were between the ages of 0 and 20. 42 The mean state EITC rate is
positively correlated with upward mobility, with a correlation of approximately 0.25 that is fairly
robust across specications. Our second proxy for the progressivity of the local tax code is the
dierence between the top state income tax rate and the state income tax rate for individuals with
taxable income of 20,000 in 2008 based on data from the Tax Foundation. There is a weak positive
correlation between local tax progressivity and upward mobility across the various specications in
Table VII, but the correlation is not statistically signicant.
In summary, we nd that areas that provide more local public goods and larger tax credits for low
income families tend to have higher levels of upward mobility. However, segregation and inequality
are much stronger and more robust predictors of the variation in intergenerational mobility than
dierences in local tax and expenditure policies.
41We drop one small CZ (Barrow, AK) in which local government revenue exceeds mean income. We analogously
exclude two outlier CZs in Alaska in which local government expenditure exceeds 50 of income when analyzing the
correlation with local government expenditure below.
42We assign stateyears without a state EITC a rate of 0 when computing this mean. See Online Appendix D for
further details on the computation of state EITC rates.
40
V.E School Quality
The local public good that may have the most direct impact on childrens outcomes is the quality
of local schools (e.g., Card and Krueger 1992). We study the correlation between mobility and
various proxies for school quality in the fourth panel of Figure X and Table VII.
We begin by analyzing mean public school expenditures per student, based on data from the
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for the 19951996 scal year. The correlation
between public school expenditures and upward mobility is roughly similar to that between local
tax rates and upward mobility, which is to be expected given that local tax revenue is used primarily
to fund schools.43
Since expenditures are not necessarily a good measure of the quality of education (Hanushek
1989), we next turn to one easily measurable input into the education production function: class
size. Prior work has demonstrated that class size has causal eects on student achievement and
longterm outcomes (Krueger 1999, Chetty et al. 2011, Fredriksson et al. 2013). We obtain data
on mean studentteacher ratios from the NCES for the 19961997 school year. 44 When pooling all
CZs, there is a strong negative correlation between class size and upward mobility (Columns 1 and
2 of Table VII). However, there is no correlation between upward mobility and class size in more
urban areas (Columns 3 and 4).
One shortcoming of inputbased measures of school quality is that they capture relatively little
of the variation in the true quality of schools (e.g., Hanushek 2003). One common approach to
addressing this problem is to use outputbased measures of quality, such as the valueadded of
teachers. We construct simple outputbased proxies for school quality based on test scores and
dropout rates adjusted for dierences in parent income. We obtain data on mean grade 38 math
and English test scores by CZ from the Global Report Card, which converts scores on statelevel
tests to a national scale to generate test score measures by school district on a single scale. We
obtain data on high school dropout rates from the NCES for the 20002001 school year, restricting
the sample to CZs in which at least 75 of school districts have nonmissing data. We regress test
scores on mean parent family income (from 19962000) in the core sample and compute residuals to
obtain an incomeadjusted measure of test score gains. We construct an incomeadjusted measure
of dropout rates analogously.
43We drop observations in the top 1 of the distribution of expenditures per student to reduce the inuence of
outliers.
44We drop observations where the mean reported class size is 0 or above 100.
41
The incomeadjusted test score and dropout rates are very highly correlated with upward mobil
ity across all specications, as shown in the fourth panel of Figure X and Table VII. In the baseline
specication (Column 1 of Table VII), the magnitude of the correlation between both measures and
upward mobility is nearly 0.6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of
schools  as judged by outputs rather than inputs  plays a role in upward mobility. At a minimum,
they strengthen the view that much of the dierence in intergenerational income mobility across
areas emerges while children are relatively young.
V.F Access to Higher Education
Having found a correlation between measures of the quality of local public schools and upward
mobility, we now turn to higher education. We construct three measures of local access to higher
education using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The rst
measure is the number of Title IV, degreegranting colleges per capita in the CZ in 2000, which is
similar to the distancebased instrument used by Card (1993). The second measure is the mean
(enrollmentweighted) tuition sticker price for instate, fulltime undergraduates for colleges in the
CZ, which reects the aordability of local higher education. The third measure is the residual
from an OLS regression of the mean (enrollmentweighted) graduation rate from colleges in the CZ
on mean parent family income in the CZ, a rough proxy for the output of local higher education.
The correlations between all three of these measures  shown in the fth panel of Figure X and
Table VII  are small and typically statistically insignicant. We also evaluated several additional
measures of access to higher education, including the mean value of institutional grants to students
enrolled in colleges in the CZ, the number of lowcost (below the national median) colleges per
capita in the CZ, and the mean distance to the nearest lowcost college. We found no signicant
relationship between any of these measures and our measures of intergenerational mobility (not
reported).
We conclude that very little of the spatial variation in intergenerational mobility is explained
by dierences in local access to higher education. Of course, this nding does not imply that
college does not play a role in upward mobility. Indeed, areas with greater upward mobility tend to
have high college attendance rates for children from lowincome families (Figure VIIIa), suggesting
that attending college is an important pathway for moving up in the income distribution. The
point here is simply that the characteristics of local colleges are not a strong predictor of childrens
success, perhaps because the marginal impact of improving local access to higher education on
42
college attendance and later outcomes is small.
V.G Labor Market Structure
Some analysts have suggested that the availability of certain types of jobs (e.g., manufacturing)
may provide ladders for lowerskilled workers to move up in the income distribution (e.g., Wilson
1996). To explore this possibility, we measure various characteristics of the local labor market: (1)
the overall employment rate in the local labor market in 2000, (2) the fraction of workers employed
in the manufacturing industry, and (3) a measure of exposure to import competition based on the
growth in Chinese imports per worker from Autor et al. (2013). As shown in the sixth panel of
Figure X and Table VII, all of these characteristics are weakly correlated with the variation in
upward mobility, with little evidence of a clear, robust relationship across specications. We also
nd no signicant correlation with other indicators such as the fraction of workers employed in
management or professional occupations or industry establishment shares (not reported).
One labor market indicator that is strongly correlated with upward mobility is the teenage labor
force participation rate. We measure the teenage labor force participation rate as the fraction of
children who have a W2 between the ages of 1416 in the 198587 birth cohorts, the earliest cohorts
for which W2 data are available at age 14 in the tax data. The unweighted correlation between the
teenage labor force participation rate and absolute upward mobility is 0.629, and this correlation is
highly robust across specications. This could be because formal jobs help disadvantaged teenagers
directly or because areas with good schools and other characteristics tend to have more teenagers
working in the formal sector. In either case, this nding mirrors the general pattern documented
above: the strongest predictors of upward mobility are factors that aect children well before they
enter the labor force as adults.
V.H Migration Rates
A large literature has evaluated whether immigration rates are related to labor market outcomes
(e.g., Altonji and Card 1989, Borjas et al. 1997). Here we evaluate whether there is a correlation
between migration rates and childrens outcomes.
We consider three measures of the extent to which a CZ is integrated with other labor markets:
(1) the migration inow rate, dened as the number of people who move into the CZ between
2004 and 2005 based on IRS Statistics of Income migration data divided by the CZ population in
2000 based on Census data, (2) the migration outow rate, dened as the number of people who
43
move out of the CZ between 2004 and 2005 divided by population in 2000, and (3) the fraction of
foreignborn individuals living in the CZ based on the 2000 Census.
The correlations between all three of these measures  shown in the seventh panel of Figure X
and Table VII  are generally quite low and statistically insignicant. In the rst two specications,
migration rates are negatively correlated with upward mobility, but in the populationweighted and
urbanarea specications, there are no signicant relationships.
V.I Social Capital
Several studies have emphasized the importance of social capital  the strength of social networks
and engagement in community organizations in local areas  for social and economic outcomes
(e.g., Coleman 1988, Borjas 1992, Putnam 1995). We explore the relationship between mobility
and measures of social capital used in prior work in the eighth panel of Figure X and Table VII.
Our primary proxy for social capital is the social capital index constructed by Rupasingha
and Goetz (2008) and employed by Putnam (2007), which we aggregate to the CZ level using
populationweighted means. This index is comprised of voter turnout rates, the fraction of people
who return their census forms, and various measures of participation in community organizations
in the area. We nd a strong positive correlation between upward mobility and social capital of
0.641 in the baseline specication, an estimate that is quite robust across specications. 45
We also consider two other proxies for social capital: the fraction of religious individuals (based
on data from the Association of Religion Data Archives) and the rate of violent crime (using data
from the Uniform Crime Report). Religiosity is very strongly positively correlated with upward
mobility, while crime rates are negatively correlated with mobility.
V.J Family Structure
Many have argued that family stability plays a key role in childrens outcomes (see e.g., Becker
1991, Murray 1984, Murray 2012). To evaluate this hypothesis, we use three measures of family
structure in the CZ based on data from the 2000 Census: (1) the fraction of children living in
singleparent households, (2) the fraction of adults who are divorced, and (3) the fraction of adults
who are married. All three of these measures are very highly correlated with upward mobility
across all the specications we consider, as shown in the ninth panel of Figure X and Table VII.
45Interestingly, one of the original measures proposed by Putnam (1995)  the number of bowling alleys in an area
has an unweighted correlation of 0.562 with our measures of absolute upward mobility.
44
The fraction of children living in singleparent households is the strongest correlate of upward
income mobility among all the variables we explored, with a raw unweighted correlation of 0.76
(see Online Appendix Figure VIIa for the corresponding nonparametric binned scatter plot). One
natural explanation for this spatial correlation is an individuallevel eect: children raised by a
single parent may have worse outcomes than those raised by two parents (e.g., Thomas and Sawhill
2002, Lamb 2004). To test whether this individuallevel eect drives the spatial correlation, we
calculate upward mobility in each CZ based only on the subsample of children whose own parents
are married. The correlation between upward mobility and the fraction of single parents in their
CZ remains at 0.66 even in this subgroup (Online Appendix Figure VIIb). Hence, family structure
correlates with upward mobility not just at the individual level but also at the community level,
perhaps because the stability of the social environment aects childrens outcomes more broadly.
The association between mobility and family structure at the community level echoes our ndings
in Section V.A on the communitylevel eects of racial shares.
V.K Comparison of Alternative Explanations
The ve factors that exhibit the strongest and most robust correlations with integenerational mo
bility are (1) segregation, (2) income inequality, (3) school quality, (4) social capital, and (5) family
structure. We conclude our analysis by assessing which of these factors are the strongest predictors
of upward mobility in multiple variable regressions.
Table IX reports estimates from regressions of absolute upward mobility or relative mobility
on our preferred proxies for these ve factors: the Theil index of racial segregation, the bottom
99 Gini coecient, high school dropout rates adjusted for income dierences, the social capital
index, and the fraction of children with single parents. As in preceding regression specications,
the dependent and independent variables are normalized to have a standard deviation of 1 in the
estimation sample in each regression in Table IX. 46
We begin in Column 1 with an unweighted OLS regression of absolute upward mobility  y25,c
on the ve factors, pooling all CZs. All of the factors except the Gini coecient are signicant
predictors of the variation in absolute upward mobility in this specication. Together, the ve
factors explain 70 of the variance in upward mobility across areas. Column 2 shows that the
coecients remain similar when state xed eects are included. Column 3 reports population
46We code the high school dropout rate as 0 for 126 CZs in which dropout rate data are missing for more than
25 of the districts in the CZ and include an indicator for having a missing high school dropout rate. We do the
same for 16 CZs that have missing data on social capital. We normalize these variables to have mean 0 and standard
deviation 1 among the CZs with nonmissing data.
45
weighted estimates, while Column 4 restricts the sample to urban areas (CZs that intersect MSAs)
and reports unweighted estimates. The estimates in Columns 3 and 4 remain roughly similar to
those in Columns 1 and 2, although the overall Rsquared of the explanatory factors is lower in
large cities. Across all the specications, the strongest and most robust predictor is the fraction of
children with single parents.
In Column 5, we use relative mobility c as the dependent variable instead of absolute upward
mobility. The fraction of singleparents and the racial segregation index are strong predictors of
dierences in relative mobility across areas, but the other factors are not statistically signicant.
To understand why this is the case, in Column 6 we replicate Column 5 but exclude the fraction
of children with single parents. In this specication, all four of the remaining factors  including the
Gini coecient  are strong predictors of the variation in relative mobility across CZs. Column 7
replicates the specication in Column 6 using absolute upward mobility as the dependent variable.
Once again, all four factors are strong predictors of upward mobility when the fraction of single
parents is excluded. These results suggest that the fraction of single parents may capture some of
the variation in the other factors, most notably the level of income inequality. Indeed, CZs with
greater inequality have signicantly higher rates of single parenthood. Hence, the results in Table
IX are consistent with the view that inequality aects childrens outcomes partly by degrading
family structure and social ties in the community.
The last column of Table IX shows that when we regress absolute upward mobility on both
the fraction of singleparent families in the CZ and the share of black residents, black shares are
no longer correlated with upward mobility. This result further supports the view that the strong
correlation of upward mobility with race operates through channels beyond the direct eect of race
on mobility and demonstrates the tremendous explanatory power of the singleparent measure.
Overall, the results in Table IX indicate that the dierences in upward mobility across areas
are better explained by a combination of the factors identied above rather than any single factor.
However, the regression coecients should be interpreted with caution for two reasons. First, all
of our proxies reect latent factors that are measured with error. Because of measurement error,
the regression may place greater weight on factors that are better measured rather than those
that are truly the strongest determinants of mobility. Second, all of the independent variables are
endogenously determined. These limitations make it dicult to identify which of the factors is the
most important determinant of upward mobility.
46
VI Conclusion
This paper has used populationwide data to present a new portrait of intergenerational income
mobility in the United States. Intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas. For
example, a child born in the bottom fth of the income distribution has a 7.8 chance of reaching
the top fth in the U.S. as a whole. But in some places, such as Salt Lake City and San Jose, the
chance of moving from the bottom fth to the top fth is as high as 12.9. In others, such as
Charlotte and Indianapolis, it is as low as 4.4. The spatial variation in intergenerational mobility
is strongly correlated with ve factors: (1) residential segregation, (2) income inequality, (3) school
quality, (4) social capital, and (5) family structure.
While we hope that these stylized facts will help guide the development of new models of inter
generational mobility, several important questions remain to be explored. Most importantly, the
descriptive analysis in this paper does not identify the causal mechanisms that drive the dierences
in upward mobility across areas. This question can be broken into two subquestions. First, is
the variation in upward mobility across areas driven by sorting (dierences in the characteristics
of the residents) or causal place eects (dierences in the institutions in an area)? Second, if place
matters, what specic policies lead to improvements in upward mobility? In ongoing work, Chetty
and Hendren (2014) study the rst question by focusing on individuals who move across areas. To
facilitate work on the second question, we have made our measures of upward and relative mobility
as well as nonparametric quintile transition matrices and other CZ and countylevel statistics
publicly available (www.equalityofopportunity.org). For instance, these statistics could be used
to study the impacts of placebased policies (Kline and Moretti 2014) on mobility.
Another dimension in which the analysis here could be expanded is by analyzing other moments
of the joint distribution of parent and child income, such as persistence at the top (e.g., the top 1)
and the degree of downward mobility. The publicly available 100 x 100 percentilelevel transition
matrices constructed here can be used to explore these questions.
Finally, this paper has presented a snapshot of intergenerational mobility for a single set of birth
cohorts. In a companion paper (Chetty et al. 2014), we use smaller random samples to study time
trends in mobility. We nd that the dierences in mobility across areas documented here persist
over time and are much larger than changes in mobility at the national level in recent decades.
Understanding why some areas of the U.S. persistently generate higher rates of intergenerational
mobility than others is an important challenge for future research.

ONLINE APPENDICES
A. Data Construction
Core and Extended Samples. We begin with the universe of individuals in the Death Master
(also known as the Data Master1) le produced by the Social Security Administration. This le
includes information on year of birth and gender for all persons in the United States with a Social
Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identication Number. We restrict this sample to all
individuals who are current US citizens as of March 2013. The Data Master1 le does not contain
historical citizenship status and thus we can only restrict to a sample who are currently US citizens
as of the time at which we access the data. We further restrict to individuals who are alive through
the end of 2012. The resulting dataset contains 47.8 million children across all cohorts 19801991
(Appendix Table I).
For each child, we dene the parent(s) as the rst person(s) who claim the child as a dependent
on a 1040 tax form. If parents are married but ling separately, we assign the child both parents.
To eliminate dependent claiming by siblings or grandparents, in the case of a potential match to
married parents or single mothers, we require the mother to be age 1540 at birth. 47 In the case of
a match to a single father, we require the father to be age 1540 at birth. If no such eligible match
occurs in 1996, the rst year of our data, we search subsequent years (through 2011) until a valid
match is found.
Once we match a child to parent(s), we hold this denition of parents xed regardless of sub
sequent dependent claims or changes in marital status. For example, a child matched to married
parents in 1996 who divorce in 1997 will always be matched to the two original parents. Conversely,
a child matched to a single parent in 1996 that marries in 1997 will be considered matched to a
single parent, though spouse income will be included in our denition of parent income because we
measure parent income at the family level in our baseline analysis.
We measure parent and child income, location, college attendance, and all other variables using
data from the IRS Databank, a balanced panel covering all individuals in the United States who
appear on any tax form between 19962012. To reduce the eects of outliers and measurement error
in the upper tail of the income distribution, we use data from the IRS Statistics of Income (SOI)
manually perfected crosssectional les spanning 19962011 (see below for details on these les).
The probability of being in the SOI sample increases with income, and approaches 1 for the highest
income individuals or those whose adjusted gross income exceeds 5 million. If an individuals
adjusted gross income exceeds 10 million, we look for the individual in the SOI sample; if present,
we use the SOI measure of adjusted gross income and wage income as reported on a F1040 return.
If not, we replace the adjusted gross income with the total wages reported on the led F1040
contained in the databank. This adjustment aects 0.017 of parents in our core sample (or,
equivalently, 1.7 of parents in the top 1 of the income distribution). Because the IRS Databank
includes tax year 2012 whereas the SOI sample does not, we top code income at 100 million for
all individuals in 2012.
Statistics of Income Sample. Starting in 1987, the IRS Statistics of Income cross sections
which are stratied random samples of tax returns  contain dependent information, allowing us
47Children can be claimed as a dependent only if they are aged less than 19 at the end of the year (less than 24 if
enrolled as a student) or are disabled. A dependent child is a biological child, step child, adopted child, foster child,
brother or sister, or a descendant of one of these (for example, a grandchild or nephew). Children must be claimed by
their custodial parent, i.e. the parent with whom they live for over half the year. Furthermore, the custodial parent
must provide more than 50 of the support to the child. Hence, working children who support themselves for more
than 50 cannot be claimed as dependents. See IRS Publication 501 for further details.
48
to link children to parents. We use the 19872011 SOI crosssections to construct a sample of
children born in the 19711991 birth cohorts and correct for errors in the upper tail of the income
distribution as described above. For each SOI crosssection from 1987 to 2007, we rst identify
all dependent children between the ages of 12 and 16 who are alive at age 30. We then pool all
the SOI crosssections that give us information for a given birth cohort. For example, the 1971
cohort is represented by children claimed at age 16 in 1987, while the 1991 cohort is comprised by
children claimed at ages 1216 in 20032007. Using the sampling weights for the SOI crosssections
(see Internal Revenue Service (2013) for details), each cohortlevel dataset is representative of the
population of children claimed on tax returns between the ages of 12 and 16 in that birth cohort.
Unlike in the populationbased samples, we do not limit the SOI sample to children who are
currently citizens because citizenship data are not fully populated for birth cohorts prior to 1980
and because we begin from a sample of children claimed by parents rather than the universe of
children who currently appear in the population data (which includes later immigrants). In the
years where the SOI and populationbased samples overlap, we obtain very similar estimates in
both samples. The citizenship restriction has a minor impact because the vast majority of children
claimed as dependents between the ages of 1216 are U.S. citizens as adults. We also do not impose
any age restrictions on the parents in the SOI sample. In the populationbased sample, some
children are claimed by dierent adults across years and the age restriction is useful to discriminate
between these potential parents. In the SOI sample, each child can only be linked to the parents
who claim her in the crosssection le, so the age restriction would not play such a role. In practice,
this restriction has little impact, as the age distribution of parents in the SOI sample is very similar
to that in the core sample using the population data.
Children whose parents are sampled in multiple SOI crosssections appear multiple times in the
SOI sample. There are 228,295 unique children in the SOI sample and 523,700 total observations.
The SOI sample grows from 4,383 unique children in 1971 to 21,231 unique children in 1991 because
we have more crosssections to link parents to children in more recent cohorts and because the size
of the SOI crosssections has increased over time (Appendix Table II). To be consistent with the
core sample denition of parent income, we dene parent income as the 5year average of parent
family income from 19962000 in the IRS Databank.
We provide additional information on the SOI sample in Chetty et al. (2014). Using sampling
weights, we show that the SOI sample represents roughly 85 of children in each birth cohort (based
on vital statistics counts) from 19711979, the cohorts we use to obtain estimates of intergenerational
mobility after age 32 in Figure IIIa. We also show that summary statistics for the SOI sample are
very similar to the core sample for the 198082 birth cohorts reported in Table I of this paper.
Note that Chetty et al. (2014) compute parent income using the income of the parents in the single
year of the parentchild match there, whereas we compute parent income as the veyear average
over 19962000 here for consistency with results from the population data. Because we restrict to
parents with positive income, this leads to a small dierence in the SOI sample used across the two
papers. For example, we have 4,384 children in the 1971 cohort, compared with 4,331 children in
the sample used by Chetty et al. (2014).
Assignment of Children to Commuting Zones. Children are assigned ZIP codes of residence
based on their parents ZIP code on the form 1040 in which the parent is matched to the child. In
the few cases where a parent les a F1040 claiming the child but does not report a valid ZIP code,
we search information returns (such as W2 and 1099G forms) for a valid ZIP code in that year.
We map these ZIP codes to counties based on the 1999 Census crosswalk between ZIP codes
and counties. We then aggregate counties into Commuting Zones using David Dorns countytoCZ
crosswalk (download le E6). The counties in the U.S. Census Bureau crosswalk and in David
Dorns crosswalk are not identical because they correspond to county denitions at dierent points
49
in time; in particular the U.S. Census Bureau crosswalk includes changes between 1990 and 1999.
We make manual adjustments for changes that aected 200 or more people. Using this procedure,
we identify the CZ of 38,839 ZIP codes. To better track individuals residing in ZIP codes that
have been created since 1999, we add an additional 477 ZIP codes not valid in 1999 but appearing
in the more uptodate 2011 HUDUSPS crosswalk. For example, in 2007, Manhattans ZIP code
10021 was split into three separate ZIP codes, resulting in the creation of new ZIP codes 10065 and
10075.
Of 9,864,965 children with nonmissing ZIP codes in our core sample, 9,778,071 were assigned a
childhood CZ using ZIP codes that existed in 1999; an additional 2,718 were assigned a CZ based
on a ZIP code that existed in 2011 but not in 1999. For simplicity, we use the same crosswalk for all
years of matching ZIP codes to CZs. We have veried that using yearspecic crosswalks from ZIP
codes to counties has a negligible eect on CZ assignments. All of the crosswalks we constructed
are available on our project website.
Some of our specications require tracking childrens locations into adulthood using the ZIP
code where they live as adults when we measure their income (e.g., for costofliving adjustments).
We dene a childs adult location using the latest nonmissing ZIP code. We rst search for a
zipcode in their 1040 form in 2012, followed by their information returns in 2012. We then repeat
this procedure for 2011 if we do not nd a zipcode in 2012. This yields 9,834,975 nonmissing child
ZIP codes in adulthood. Of these, we match 9,537,283 to a CZ from a ZIP code using the 1999
crosswalk (i.e. this zipcode was in use in 1999) and an additional 198,317 using the later crosswalk
because the ZIP code was created after 1999.
Construction of ZIPLevel Racial Shares. To construct Figure IXb and IXc, which condition
on racial shares at the ZIP level, we need data on racial shares by ZIP code. The 2000 Census
includes summary tables by ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) instead of ZIP code. ZCTAs are
a U.S. Census Bureau geographical unit that in most cases correspond closely to ZIP codes, but
sometimes do not. We use a ZCTA to ZIP Crosswalk from the John Snow Institute to assign each
ZIP code a racial share based on Census 2000 ZCTAlevel data from form P008.
CZLevel Price Index. To measure real incomes, we rst construct a CZlevel ACCRA price
index using the 2010 ACCRA composite cost of living index (table 728) for urbanized areas
in 2010, which we crosswalk to CZs as follows. First, we use the 2012Q12013Q1 correspondence
(downloaded on 11212013) to assign 298 out of the 325 urbanized areas to MSAs. Each county in
an MSA was assigned the same value of the index. We then merge counties to CZs and calculate an
unweighted mean of the index among nonmissing values within the CZ. Some CZs had no counties
within an MSA and were therefore assigned a missing value of the ACCRA index.
To construct a price index that covers all CZs, we regress the CZlevel ACCRA index on a
quadratic in log population density (from the 2000 Census), a quadratic in log median housing
values, the latitude and longitude of the CZ centroid, and state xed eects. Housing values are
the populationweighted mean of tract median housing values for owneroccupied units in the 1990
Census short form. Latitude and longitude are the mean latitude and longitude across counties
within each CZ, obtained from the Census 2000 Gazetteer countylevel data. The predicted values
from this regression constitute our nal price index that covers all CZs.
B. Comparison to Survey Datasets
In Appendix Table III, we compare selected moments of income distributions and other variables
in the tax data to data from two nationally representative surveys that have been used in prior
work on the income distribution: the 201112 CPS and the 201112 ACS. We restrict the ACS and
CPS samples to citizens in the same birth cohorts as our core sample (198082). To the extent
possible, we dene all income variables to match the concepts in the tax data.
50
To assess whether our method of linking children to parents based on dependent claiming creates
selection bias, we compute statistics in the tax data both on the full sample of all children in the
198082 birth cohorts who are current U.S. citizens and the core sample of children linked to parents.
Because most children are linked to parents, the dierences between these two samples are small,
though children who lack valid parent matches have slightly lower earnings on average.
Overall, the tax data are very similar to the CPS and ACS. The sum of the sampling weights
in our survey based samples provide estimates of the size of the target population being sampled.
This population is very similar in the tax data and the two surveys. The mean and median earnings
levels are very similar, as are the fractions with nonzero income. Perhaps more surprisingly, the
interquartile range (P75P25) of earnings is also similar across the three data sources. If survey
data were reported with classical measurement error, we would expect the interquartile range to be
larger in survey sources. However, survey reports of income exhibit mean reverting measurement
error which has the eect of reducing variability (Bound and Krueger 1991; Bound et al. 2001).
Moreover, survey nonresponse tends to follow a Ushaped pattern (Kline and Santos 2013), with
very high and low earning individuals being least likely to provide earnings responses, which can
further reduce variability. The quantiles of family income also line up well across the three data
sources, with the taxbased moments strongly resembling those from the ACS, perhaps because the
ACS has a higher response rate for earnings than the CPS.
C. Comparison to Mazumder (2005)
Mazumder (2005) reports that even 5year averages of parent earnings exhibit substantial at
tenuation bias because of longlasting transitory shocks to income. This appendix provides further
details on why we nd much less attenuation bias than Mazumder.
Mazumder (2005, Table 4, row 1, page 246) obtains IGE estimates as high as 0.6 when using
15year averages of parent income matched SIPPSSA administrative data, 54 larger than his 4
year pooled estimate of 0.388. In contrast, we nd little dierence between IGEs based on veyear
vs. fteenyear averages of parent income both using our preferred rankrank specication (Figure
IIIb) and using a loglog IGE specication similar to that estimated by Mazumder. In particular,
we obtain a loglog IGE of 0.366 using a 15year average of parent family income, closer to the
estimates of Solon (1992) than Mazumders estimates.
We believe our results dier from Mazumders ndings because we directly observe income for
all individuals in our data, whereas Mazumder imputes parent income based on race and education
for up to 60 of the observations in his sample to account for topcoding in social security records.
These imputations are analogous to instrumenting for parent income using race and education, an
approach known to yield higher estimates of the IGE, perhaps because parents education directly
aects childrens earnings (e.g., Solon, 1992, Zimmerman, 1992, Mulligan, 1997, Solon, 1999). Be
cause the SSA earnings limit is lower in the early years of his sample, Mazumder imputes income
for a larger fraction of observations when he averages parent income over more years (Mazumder
2005, Figure 3). As a result, Mazumders estimates eectively converge toward IV estimates as he
uses more years to calculate mean parent income, explaining why his estimates rise so sharply with
the number of years used to measure parent income. Consistent with this explanation, when he
drops imputed observations, his IGE estimates increase much less with the number of years used
to measure parent income (Mazumder 2005, Table 6).
Mazumder also reports simulations of earnings processes showing that attenuation bias in the
IGE should be substantial even when using veyear averages. However, he calibrates the param
eters of the earnings process in his simulation based on estimates from survey data, which have
much more noise than administrative records. If one replicates Mazumders simulations using a
51
smaller variance share for transitory shocks, one obtains results similar to ours in Figure IIIb, with
little attenuation bias in estimates based on veyear averages.
To be clear, Mazumder himself acknowledges the potential bias due to imputation, as he rec
ommends in his conclusion that future research should attempt to verify the results here using
longterm measures of permanent earnings from other sources that do not require the kind of
imputations that were necessary in this study. Our analysis simply follows this recommendation.
D. Construction of CZLevel Covariates
This appendix supplements Online Data Table IX by providing further details about our CZ
covariates used in Section V. Online Data Table IX contains detailed descriptions of each CZ
covariate and briey describes the source of data for each variable. Here, we provide additional
details on each data source along with links to original sources. As a reference, we provide Stata
code on our website that constructs the nal CZlevel covariates (data available in Online Data
Table VIII) from the raw data downloaded from the links below.
Our source data are primarily at the ZIP code and county level. We map ZIP codes and
counties to CZs using the procedure described in Appendix A. We compute CZlevel means of the
ZIP and countylevel data using populationweighted averages, with population counts from the
2000 Census.
Race and Segregation. Racial shares are calculated from the 2000 census short form (SF1) table
P008. Note that all Census data can be obtained by searching for the relevant census table on the
U.S. Census Bureaus American FactFinder. The black share is dened as the number of people
in a CZ that are black alone divided by the CZ population; the white share is calculated similarly.
For the Hispanic share, the numerator is the number of people of any race that are Hispanic. We
also calculate a residual category where the numerator is the number of people that are neither
black alone nor white alone nor Hispanic.
We calculate several indices of social and economic segregation. We compute the racial segrega
tion index using the census tract level data on racial shares from Table P008 from the 2000 Census.
For segregation of auence and poverty, we use the sample data from the 2000 census long form
(SF3) on the income distribution of households in 1999 by census tract contained in table P052.
Our formulas for the three income segregation measures are taken directly from Reardon (2011).
We compute H(pk) for each of the 16 income groups given in table P052. We then estimate H(p25)
and H(p75) in each CZ using the 4th order polynomial version of the weighted linear regression in
equation 12 on page 23 of Reardon (2011). The overall segregation of income index is Reardons
rankorder index, which we compute from equation 13, where the  vector is given in Appendix A4
of Reardon (2011).
To compute the commute time variable, we divide the number of workers that commute for less
than 15 minutes by the total number of workers. The sample for both of these counts is restricted
to workers that are at least 16 years old and do not work from home. Travel time data is from the
2000 census table P031.
Income Distributions. We compute mean income per working age adult by dividing aggregate
household income in a CZ by the total number of people aged 1664 in that CZ. These data come
from the 2000 census table P054 and P008. The Gini coecient, fraction middle class, and top 1
income share are computed using our sample of parents and the family income denitions used for
the main analysis in this paper, but with family income top coded at 100 million in all years.
Taxes and Government Expenditures. We estimate local tax rates using data on tax revenue
by county from the U.S. Census Bureaus 1992 Census of Government countylevel summaries,
which we downloaded from the ICPSR. In particular, Part 2 of the ICPSR download contains
52
the countylevel summaries. We dene the tax rate in each CZ as follows. First, we calculate
county tax revenue divided by the county population estimate for each county in the CZ. We
then take a populationweighted mean across these counties to obtain a CZlevel mean perperson
taxes. Finally, we divide mean perperson taxes by the Census 2000 estimate of nominal income
per household from 2000 census table P052. We code the tax rate as missing for one CZ (Barrow,
Alaska), which has a calculated tax rate that exceeds 1.
We compute total government spending per capita in each county using Census data on govern
ment expenditures by aggregating all countylevel total expenditure categories and dividing by the
1992 county population estimates. We then construct a CZlevel measure by taking population
weighted means of expenditures per capita in the counties in each CZ. We code local government
expenditures as missing for two CZs (Barrow, Alaska and Kotzebue, Alaska), which have unusually
high expenditures per capita that exceed 50 of per capita income.
We measure state income tax progressivity as the dierence between 2008 state income tax
rates for incomes above 100,000 and incomes in the bottom tax bracket using data from the Tax
Foundation. We obtain data on State EITC rates by year from Hotz and Scholz (2003). We
calculate mean EITC rate for the years 19802001, setting the rate to zero for stateyear pairs
where there was no state EITC. Note that Wisconsins state EITC rate depends on the number of
children in a household; we use the rate for households with two children.
K12 Education. We use the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data
data for public schools for several of our K12 covariates. School expenditures per student is taken
from schooldistrict data for the 19961997 scal year. We drop 7 CZs that are in the top 1 of
the distribution of expenditures per student to reduce the inuence of outliers.
We use schoollevel data on studentteacher ratios for the 19961997 school year. We drop
the top 0.1 of observations, which have studentteacher ratios that exceed 100. We also drop
approximately 10 of schools whose studentteacher ratios are recorded as being 0.
High school dropout rates are obtained from schooldistrict data for the 20002001 school year.
We code the dropout rate as missing in CZs in which more than 25 of school districts have missing
data on dropout rates. We construct an incomeadjusted measure of dropout rates using residuals
from a CZlevel regression of the dropout rate on mean parent family income (from 19962000) in
the core sample.
We obtain a standardized measure of grade 38 test scores from the National Math Percentile and
National Reading Percentile series in the Global Report Card. The Global Report Card constructs
national math and reading score percentiles for each school district by rst calculating the districts
statelevel zscore for the share of students in the district scoring at the procient level and above on
statewide standardized tests, then adjusting for the relative diculty of achieving the prociency
cuto in each state, and nally recentering the distribution of adjusted district zscores for each
state at that states zscore for average student scores on the National Assessment of Education
Progress Exam. We calculate the studentweighted mean of the math and reading rankings over
2004, 2005, and 2007 in each CZ to arrive at our measure of mean test scores. We then construct a
measure of incomeadjusted test scores using the residual from a CZlevel regression of mean test
scores on mean parent family income (from 19962000) in the core sample.
We construct enrollmentweighted means at the ZIP code level of all the school and school
district level variables using the school and district ZIP codes provided in each of the data sources.
We then take enrollmentweighted means across ZIP codes to construct CZlevel estimates using
the ZIP to CZ crosswalk discussed in Appendix A.
Higher Education. We use the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to
construct our three measures of college access and quality. We restrict the sample to Title IV
institutions that have undergraduate students, and are degree oering. The number of colleges per
53
capita in each CZ is the number of institutions in the 2000 IPEDS in each CZ divided by the CZ
population. We dene college tuition as the mean instate tuition and fees for rsttime, fulltime
undergraduates for the institutions in each CZ. We dene the enrollmentweighted mean graduation
rate based on the 150 of normal time college graduation rate from IPEDS 2009, the rst year for
which this data is available. We construct a measure of incomeadjusted graduation rates using the
residual from a CZlevel regression of graduation rates on mean parent income in the core sample.
Local Labor Market Conditions. The labor force participation rate is dened as the number of
people in the labor force by the total population in the sample of people that are at least 16 years
old. These data are from the 2000 Census long form (SF3) in table P043. We compute the share
of workers in manufacturing from the 2000 census in table P049; we divide the number of people
working in manufacturing by the total number of workers.
The exposure to Chinese trade variable is the percentage change in imports per worker from
China between 1990 and 2000. It is measured as the growth in imports allocated to a CZ, divided
by the CZ work force in 1990 (with the growth rate dened as 10 times the annualized change).
This variable was constructed by Autor et al. (2013) and provided to us by David Dorn.
The teenage labor force participation rate is dened in each CZ as the share of individuals who
received one or more W2s between the ages of 14 and 16. We calculate the teenage LFP rate
using W2 data for the 19851987 birth cohorts, the earliest cohorts for which we have W2 data at
age 14.
Migration Rates. For inow and outow migration data, we use the countytocounty migration
data from the Internal Revenue Services Statistics of Income for 20042005. Inow migration is the
number of people moving into a CZ from counties in other CZs divided by the total CZ population;
outow migration is calculated similarly. We compute the share of each CZs population that is
foreign born using sample data from the 2000 census (table P021) on the number of foreign born
inhabitants divided by total CZ population. In both cases, total CZ population is the sum of county
populations from the 2000 Census (table P008) over counties in the CZ.
Social Capital. For social capital, we use the 1990 countylevel social capital index from Ru
pasingha and Goetz (2008). For religious aliation, we use data on the selfreported number of
religious adherents from the Association of Religion Data Archives at Pennsylvania State Univer
sity. Data on crime rates are from the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting program. We downloaded
countylevel data from the ICPSR and use the number of arrests for serious (part 1 index) violent
crimes divided by the total covered population.
Family Structure. We dene the share of single mothers in each county as the number of
households with female heads (and no husband present) with own children present divided by the
total number of households with own children present. These data from from the 2000 census long
form (SF3) in table P015. We calculate the fraction married and fraction divorced in each county
using the number of people that are married or divorced (in the sample of people that are 15 years
and older) using data from the 2000 census in table P018.

Summary Statistics for Core Sample: Children Born in 198082
9,867,736
Notes: The table presents summary statistics for the core sample. The core sample of children
includes all current U.S. citizens with a valid SSN or ITIN who are (1) born in birth cohorts 198082, (2)
for whom we are able to identify parents based on dependent claiming, and (3) whose mean parent
income over the years 19962000 is strictly positive. Child income is the average of 20112012 (when
the child was 30) while parent family income is the average from 19962000. Family income is total pre
tax household income. Top earner's income is the income of the higherearning parent from 1999
2003 (when W2's are available). Parents' marital status is measured in the year the parent is matched
to the child. Child's individual income is the sum of W2 wage earnings, UI benefits, and SSDI benefits,
and half of any remaining income reported on the 1040 form. Individual earnings includes W2 wage
earnings, UI benefits, SSDI income, and selfemployment income. A child is defined as single if heshe
does not file with a spouse in 2011 and 2012. College attendance is defined as ever attending college
from age 18 to 21, where attending college is defined as presence of a 1098T form. Teenage birth is
defined (for females only) as having a child while being aged 19 or less. See Section II and Online
Appendix A for additional details on sample and variable definitions. All dollar values are reported in
2012 dollars, deflated using the CPIU.

Sample
Notes: Each cell in this table reports the coefficient from a univariate OLS regression of the variable for children (listed in the first column) on the variable
for parents (listed in the second column) for the corresponding sample (listed in columns 16). Column 1 uses the core sample (198082 birth cohorts); see
notes to Table 1 for further details on the definition of the core sample. Columns 2 and 3 limit the sample used in column 1 to males or females. Columns
4 and 5 limit the sample to children whose parents were married or unmarried in the year the child was linked to the parent. Column 6 uses all children in
the 198085 birth cohorts. Child family income is the mean of 201112 family income, while parent family income is the mean from 19962000. Parent top
earner income is the mean income of the higherearning spouse between 19992003 (when W2 data are available). See notes to Table 1 for definition of
child individual income and earnings. In columns 15, income percentile ranks are constructed by ranking all children relative to others in their birth cohort
based on the relevant income definition and ranking all parents relative to other parents in the core sample. Ranks are always defined on the full sample of
all children; that is, they are not redefined within the subsamples in Columns 25. In column 6, parents are ranked relative to other parents with children in
the 198085 birth cohorts. College attendance is defined as ever attending college from age 18 to 21, where attending college is defined as presence of a
1098T form. Teenage birth is defined as having a child while between age 13 and 19. The number of observations corresponds to the specification in row
4. The number of observations is approximately 7 lower in row one because we exclude children with zero income. The number of observations is
approximately 50 lower in row 8 because we restrict to the sample of female children. There are 866 children in the core sample with unknown sex,
which is why the number of observations in the core sample is not equal to the sum of the observations in the male and female samples.

TABLE IV
Intergenerational Mobility in the 50 Largest Commuting Zones
Notes: This table reports our baseline estimates of intergenerational mobility for the 50 largest commuting zones (CZs) according to
their populations in the 2000 Census. The CZs are sorted in descending order by absolute upward mobility (Column 4). The mobility
measures are calculated using the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and the baseline family income definitions described in Table
1. The measures in columns 4 and 6 are both derived from withinCZ OLS regressions of child income rank against parent income
rank. Column 6 reports the slope coefficient from this regression, which is equal to the difference in mean child income rank between
children with parents in the 100th percentile and children with parents in the 0th percentile (divided by 100). Column 4 reports the
predicted value at parent income rank equal to 25 (Y25). Under linearity of the rankrank relationship, this is equal to the average rank
of children with parents in the bottom half of the distribution. Column 5 reports the percentage of children whose family income is in
the top quintile of the national distribution of child family income conditional on having parent family income in the bottom quintile of
the parental national income distribution  these probabilities are taken directly from Online Data Table VII. See Online Data Table V
for estimates for all CZs as well as estimates using alternative samples and income definitions. See Online Data Tables III and IV for
estimates by county and MSA.

Correlation with Baseline Mobility Estimates
Robustness of Intergenerational Mobility Measures to Alternative Specifications
TABLE V
Notes: Each cell in this table reports the correlation across CZs of a baseline mobility measure (using child family income rank and parent family
income rank in the core sample) with an alternative mobility measure, defined using a different sample (Panel A), a different income measure for
parents or children (Panel B), adjusting for cost of living or other factors (Panel C), or using earlier outcomes (Panel D). Column (1) reports the
unweighted correlation of the alternative and baseline measures of absolute upward mobility, the expected rank of children whose parents are at the
25th national percentile. Column (2) reports the unweighted correlation of the alternative and baseline measures of relative mobility, the slope of the
rankrank relationship. Columns (3) and (4) repeat Columns (1) and (2) weighting the correlations by CZ population as recorded in the 2000 Census.
All absolute and relative mobility measures are constructed using OLS regressions of child ranks (or college or teenage birth indicators) on parent
ranks as described in the text. Ranks are always defined in the full sample, prior to defining specific subsamples. See text for further details on each
alternative measure.

TABLE VI
Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility
Notes: Each column reports coefficients from an OLS regression with standard errors clustered at the state level reported
in parentheses. The regressions are run using data for the 709 CZs with at least 250 children in the core sample. The
dependent variable in all columns is our baseline measure of absolute upward mobility, the expected rank of children
whose parents are at the 25th national percentile. All independent and dependent variables are normalized (in the relevant
estimation sample) to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, so univariate regression coefficients equal correlation
coefficients. Column 2 and 5 restrict to the sample of CZs that intersect an MSA. Racial segregation is measured by the
Theil index defined in equation (3) using racial shares at the census tract level. Income segregation is measured by a
weighted average of twogroup Theil indices, as in Reardon (2011); see equation (4). Segregation of poverty is a two
group Theil index, where the groups are defined as being above vs. below the 25th percentile of the local household
income distribution. Segregation of affluence is defined analogously at the 75th percentile. Share with commute 15
minutes is the fraction of working individuals in each CZ who commute less than 15 minutes to work.

Notes: Each cell reports estimates from OLS regressions of a measure of mobility on the variable listed in each row, normalizing both the dependent and independent variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the estimation
sample, so that univariate regression coefficients equal correlation coefficients. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered at the state level. The dependent variable in columns 15 is our baseline measure of absolute upward
mobility, the expected rank of children whose parents are at the 25th national percentile. The dependent variable in column 6 is relative mobility, the rankrank slope in each CZ. All mobility estimates are constructed using the core sample
(198082 cohorts) and baseline family income measures. Column 1 reports estimates from univariate unweighted regressions (raw correlation coefficients). Column 2 adds state fixed effects. Column 3 weights by Census 2000 population
(and normalizes variables by weighted standard deviations). In column 4, we restrict to CZs that intersect a Metropolitan Statistical Area. In column 5 we control for the black share and income growth between 2000 and 20062010 as
measured in Census data. The typical sample in column 4 consists of 325 CZs that intersect MSAs. In the other columns the typical sample consists of the 709 CZs with at least 250 children in the core sample; however, some rows have
fewer observations due to missing values for the independent variable. See Section V, Online Data Table IX, and Online Appendix D for definitions of each of the correlates analyzed in this table. See Online Data Table VII for the CZlevel

Notes: Each column reports regression coefficients from an OLS regression with all variables normalized to have mean 0 and standard
deviation 1 in the estimation sample, so univariate regression coefficients are equal to correlation coefficients. Columns 15 are estimated
using data for the 709 CZs with at least 250 children in the core sample. The dependent variable in columns 14 is our baseline CZlevel
measure of absolute upward mobility; in column 5 the dependent variable is relative mobility. In column 3, we restrict to CZs that intersect
MSAs. In columns 15, the Gini coefficient is defined as the Gini coefficient of family income for parents in the core sample in each CZ; the
top 1 income share is defined as the fraction of total parent family income in each CZ accruing to the richest 1 of parents in that CZ; the
Gini Bottom 99 is defined as the Gini coefficient minus the top 1 income share; and the fraction between p25 and p75 is the fraction of
parents in each CZ whose family income is between the 25th and 75th percentile of the national distribution of parent family income for those
in the core sample. In columns 68, the dependent variable is the loglog IGE estimate by country from Corak (2013, Figure 1). The Gini
coefficients across countries are obtained from the OECD Income Distribution Database (series "Income Distribution and Poverty: by
country"). We interpret these coefficients as applying to the bottom 99 because the surveys on which they are based are typically top
coded. The top 1 income share across countries is from the World Top Income Database (series "Top 1 Income Share"). The
independent variables are measured in 1985 in column 6 and 7 and in 2005 in column 8.

Notes: Each column reports coefficients from an OLS regression with standard errors clustered at the state level reported in
parentheses. The regressions are run using data for the 709 CZs with at least 250 children in the core sample. The dependent
variable in columns 14 and 78 is our baseline measure of absolute upward mobility, the expected rank of children whose parents
are at the 25th national percentile. The dependent variable in columns 5 and 6 is relative mobility, the rankrank slope within each
CZ. All independent and dependent variables are normalized (in the relevant estimation sample) to have mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. Column 1 reports unweighted estimates across all CZs. Column 2 includes state fixed effects. Column 3 weights by
population (and normalizes variables by weighted standard deviations). In column 4, we restrict to CZs that intersect MSAs.
Columns 58 replicate the unweighted specification in Column 1 with different dependent and independent variables. Racial
segregation is measured by the Theil index defined in equation (3) using racial shares at the census tract level. Gini bottom 99
is the Gini coefficient minus the top 1 income share within each CZ, computed using the distribution of parent family income
within each CZ for parents in the core sample. Incomeresidualized high school dropout rate is the residual from a regression of
the fraction of children who drop out of high school in the CZ, estimated using data from the NCES Common Core of Data for the
200001 school year, on mean household income in 2000. Social capital index is the standardized index of social capital
constructed by Rupasingha and Goetz (2008). Fraction single mothers is the fraction of children being raised by single mothers in
each CZ. We code the high school dropout rate as 0 for 128 CZs in which dropout rate data are missing for more than 25 of the
districts in the CZ, and include an indicator for having a missing high school dropout rate. We do the same for 16 CZs with
missing data on social capital. See Section V, Online Data Table IX, and Online Appendix D for additional details on the
definitions of each of these variables.

Sample Sizes vs. Vital Statistics Counts by Birth Cohort
Notes: Column 1 reports the size of each birth cohort from 19871991, based on data from vital
statistics obtained from the US Statistical Abstract 2012, Table 78. The remaining columns report
the number of individuals in the population tax data as a percentage of the total number in the
birth cohort, imposing the additional restrictions listed in the header of each column. Column 2
reports the number of individuals born in each cohort who are in the DM1 tax database, are
current US citizens, and are alive in 2013. This column can differ from the birth cohort due to
immigration and naturalization, emigration, and deaths before 2012. The percentage of citizens in
the DM1 data rises in 1981 because citizenship status is missing for some individuals born before
1981. Column 3 further requires the individuals to be matched to parents (i.e., claimed as children
dependents on individual income tax returns by a person aged 1540 at the time of the birth of the
child) in 1996 or after. Column 4, which requires in addition that parents have positive mean
income between 19962000, is our key sample of interest for all national level statistics. Column 5
further requires valid geographical information (ZIP code) for parents. Column 5 is our key sample
of interest for all local area statistics. The core sample includes the 19802 cohorts. The extended
sample includes the 198091 cohorts.

Notes: Columns (1) and (5) include all individuals in the Data Master1 file from the SSA who were born in 19801982, are current U.S. citizens, and lived
through 2012. In Columns (2) and (6), we impose the additional restriction that an individual was claimed as a dependent on a tax return in the years 1996
2012 by parents with positive income as described in the text. CPS sample consists of civilian, noninstitutionalized citizens age 2931 in the 2011 wave
and 3032 in 2012 waves of the Current Population Survey. ACS sample consists of civilian, noninstitutionalized citizens born between 19801982 in the
2011 and 2012 American Community Surveys. Earned income refers to wages and salary plus social security and unemployment insurance plus positive
selfemployment income, except for the ACS measure, which does not include unemployment insurance. IRS wages and salary income is defined as the
amount of all wages, tips, and other compensation before any payroll deductions (total of all amounts reported on all Forms W2, Box 1). IRS
unemployment compensation is defined as the amount of Unemployment Compensation and Railroad Retirement Board payments prior to tax
withholding as reported on Form 1099G, Box 1. IRS social security income is defined as total Social Security Administration benefits, as reported on
Form SSA1099 (as well as any Railroad Retirement Board benefits paid, as reported on Form RRB1099, Box 3). IRS selfemployment income is
defined as the profit reported on Form 1040 Schedule C. In the CPS, selfemployment income is business income; in the ACS, it is both farm and non
farm business income. In the tax data, total income is the sum of Adjusted Gross Income, social security, and tax exempt interest. Total income in CPS
and ACS is all reported income including negative business and investment income. All dollar amounts are in 2012 dollars. Married refers to filing of joint
return in 20112012 period for the tax data, and selfreport of currently married in CPSACS samples. College means attended a degree granting
institution between the ages of 18 and 21 in the tax data and selfreport of more than high school attainment in CPSACS samples. South refers to filing a
federal tax return in (for tax data) or being surveyed in (for ACSCPS) one of the following states: DE, DC, FL, GA, MD, NC, SC, VA, WV, AL, KY, MS,
TN, AR, LA, OK, TX. ACS and CPS moments computed using sampling weights (inverse probability of inclusion in sample). For the ACS and CPS, the
sum of the sample weights is the average of the sum of the sample weights in 2011 and in 2012.

Notes: These gures present nonparametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between child income and parent income.
Both gures are based on the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and baseline family income denitions for parents and
children. Child income is the mean of 20112012 family income (when the child was around 30), while parent income is mean
family income from 19962000. Incomes are in 2012 dollars. To construct Panel A, we bin parent family income into 100
equalsized (centile) bins and plot the mean level of child income vs. mean level of parent income within each bin. For scaling
purposes, we do not show the point for the top 1 in Panel A, as mean parent income in the top 1 is 1.4 million. In Panel
B, we again bin parent family income into 100 bins and plot mean log income for children (left yaxis) and the fraction of
children with zero family income (right yaxis) vs. mean parents log income. Children with zero family income are excluded
from the log income series. In both panels, the 10th and 90th percentile of parents income are depicted in dashed vertical
lines. The coecient estimates and standard errors (in parentheses) reported on the gures are obtained from OLS regressions
on the micro data. In Panel A, we report separate slopes for parents below the 90th percentile and parents between the 90th
and 99th percentile. In panel B, we report slopes of the loglog regression (i.e., the intergenerational elasticity of income or
IGE) in the full sample and for parents between the 10th and 90th percentiles.

Notes: These gures present nonparametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between child and parent income ranks.
Both gures are based on the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and baseline family income denitions for parents and
children. Child income is the mean of 20112012 family income (when the child was around 30), while parent income is mean
family income from 19962000. We dene a childs rank as her family income percentile rank relative to other children in
her birth cohort and his parents rank as their family income percentile rank relative to other parents of children in the core
sample. Panel A plots the mean child percentile rank within each parental percentile rank bin. The series in triangles in Panel
B plots the analogous series for Denmark, computed by Boserup, Kopczuk, and Kreiner (2013) using a similar sample and
income denitions (see text for details). The series in circles reproduces the rankrank relationship in the U.S. from Panel A
as a reference. The slopes and bestt lines are estimated using an OLS regression on the micro data for the U.S. and on the
binned series (as we do not have access to the micro data) for Denmark. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: This gure evaluates the robustness of the rankrank slope estimated in Figure IIa to changes in the age at which
child income is measured (Panel A) and the number of years used to measure parents income (Panel B). In both panels, child
income is dened as mean family income in 20112012. In Panel A, parent income is dened as mean family income from
19962000. Each point in Panel A shows the slope coecient from a separate OLS regression of child income rank on parent
income rank, varying the childs birth cohort and hence the age at which child income is measured in 201112. The blue dots
use the extended sample in the population data, while the red triangles use the 0.1 Statistics of Income stratied random
sample. The rst point in Panel A corresponds to the children in the 1990 birth cohort, who are 2122 when their incomes
are measured in 201112 (denoted by age 22 on the gure). The last point for which we have populationwide estimates
corresponds to the 1980 cohort, who are 3132 (denoted by 32) when their incomes are measured. The last point in the SOI
sample corresponds to the 1972 cohort, who are 3940 (denoted by 40) when their incomes are measured. The dashed red line
is a lowess curve t through the SOI 0.1 sample rankrank slope estimates. In Panel B, we focus on children in the core
sample (198082 birth cohorts) in the population data. Each point in this gure shows the coecient from the same rankrank
regression as in Figure IIa, varying the number of years used to compute mean parent income. The rst point uses parent
income data for 1996 only to dene parent ranks. The second point uses mean parent income from 19961997. The last point
uses mean parent income from 19962012, a 17 year average.

rates (Panel A) and teenage birth rates (Panel B) vs. the percentile rank of parent family income. Both gures are based on
the core sample (198082 birth cohorts). Parent income is mean family income from 19962000. Panel A plots the fraction of
children ever attending college between age 1821 within each parental percentile bin. College attendance is dened by the
presence of a 1098T form led by a college on behalf of the student. Panel B plots the fraction of female children who give
birth while teenagers within each parental percentile bin. Teenage birth is dened as ever claiming a dependent child who
was born while the mother was aged 1319. The regression coecients, standard errors, and bestt lines are estimated on
the micro data.

Notes: These gures present nonparametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between child and parent income ranks
in selected CZs. Both gures are based on the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and baseline family income denitions for
parents and children. Children are assigned to commuting zones based on the location of their parents (when the child was
claimed a dependent), irrespective of where they live as adults. Parent and child percentile ranks are always dened at the
national level, not the CZ level. To construct each series, we group parents into 50 equally sized (two percentile point) bins
and plot the mean child percentile rank vs. the mean parent percentile rank within each bin. We report two measures of
mobility based on the rankrank relationships in each CZ. The rst is relative mobility (y100  y0), which is 100 times the
rankrank slope estimate. The second is absolute upward mobility (y25), the predicted child income rank at the 25th percentile
of parent income distribution, depicted by the dashed vertical line in the gures. All mobility statistics and bestt lines are
estimated on the underlying the micro data.
FIGURE VI: The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility

B. Relative Mobility: RankRank Slopes (y100  y0)100 by CZ
Notes: These gures present heat maps of our two baseline measures of intergenerational mobility by commuting zone (CZ).
Both gures are based on the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and baseline family income denitions for parents and
children. Children are assigned to commuting zones based on the location of their parents (when the child was claimed a
dependent), irrespective of where they live as adults. In each CZ, we regress child income rank on a constant and parent
income rank. Using the regression estimates, we dene Absolute Upward Mobility ( y25) as the intercept  25(rankrank
slope), which corresponds to the predicted child rank given parent income at the 25th percentile (see Figure V). We dene
relative mobility as the rankrank slope; the dierence between the outcomes of the child from the richest and poorest family
is 100 times this coecient (y100  y0). The maps are constructed by grouping CZs into ten deciles and shading the areas so
that lighter colors correspond to higher absolute mobility (Panel A) and lower rankrank slopes (Panel B). Areas with fewer
than 250 children in the core sample, for which we have inadequate data to estimate mobility, are shaded with the crosshatch
pattern. In Panel B, we report the unweighted and populationweighted correlation coecients between relative mobility and
absolute mobility across CZs. The CZlevel statistics underlying these gures are reported in Online Data Table V.

Notes: These gures illustrate the correlation between relative mobility and absolute mobility at various percentiles of the
income distribution. To construct Panel A, we rst calculate the mean income rank of children in CZ c with parents in
(national) percentile p, denoted by pc. We then run a CZlevel regression of  pc on relative mobility (y100c  y0c) at each
percentile p separately. Panel A plots the resulting regression coecients p vs. the percentile p. The coecient p can be
interpreted as the mean impact of a 1 unit increase in relative mobility on the absolute outcomes of children whose parents are
at percentile p. We also plot the best linear t across the 100 coecients. This line, estimated using an OLS regression, crosses
zero at percentile p 85.1. This implies that increases in relative mobility are associated with higher expected rank outcomes
for children with parents below percentile 85.1 and lower expected rank outcomes for children with parents above percentile
85.1. To illustrate the intuition for this result, Panel B plots hypothetical rankrank relationships in two representative CZs,
one of which has more relative mobility than the other. Panel A implies that in such a pairwise comparison, the two rankrank
relationships cross at the 85th percentile on average, as illustrated in Panel B.

Notes: These gures present heat maps of college attendance and teenage birth rate by parent income gradients across
commuting zones. Both gures are based on the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and baseline family income denitions
for parents. Children are assigned to commuting zones based on the location of their parents (when the child was claimed a
dependent), irrespective of where they live as adults. In Panel A, we regress an indicator for the child ever attending college
between ages 1821 on parents national income rank to estimate the slope by CZ, as shown in Figure IV at the national
level. College attendance is dened by the presence of a 1098T form led by a college on behalf of the student. Panel B
repeats this analysis using an indicator for teenage birth, restricting the sample to female children. Teenage birth is dened as
ever claiming a dependent child who was born while the mother was aged 1319. The maps are constructed by grouping CZs
into ten deciles and shading the areas so that lighter colors correspond to smaller slopes in magnitude (i.e., greater relative
mobility). Areas with fewer that 250 children in the core sample, for which we have inadequate data to estimate mobility,
are shaded with the crosshatch pattern. We report the unweighted and populationweighted correlation coecients between
these slopes and the relative mobility measures in Figure VIb across CZs. The CZlevel statistics underlying these gures are
reported in Online Data Table V.

Notes: Panel A presents a binned scatter plot of absolute upward mobility ( y25) vs. the fraction of black residents in a CZ
(based on data from the 2000 Census). To construct this gure, we group CZs into twenty equally sized bins (vingtiles) based
on their fraction of black residents. We then plot the mean level of absolute upward mobility vs. the mean black share within
each of the twenty bins (log scale). The best linear t and the correlation between the two variables are estimated using the
underlying CZlevel data, with standard error (reported in parentheses) clustered by state. The correlations are in levels (not
log black share) for consistency with Table VII. Panel B presents a heat map of absolute upward mobility for individuals living
in ZIP codes with 80 or more white residents. This gure replicates Figure VIa, restricting the sample used to estimate the
rankrank regression in each CZ to parents living in ZIP codes with 80 or more white residents. Note that we color the entire
CZ based on the resulting estimate of upward mobility (not just the ZIP codes used in the estimation) for comparability to
other gures. CZs with fewer than 250 children living in ZIP codes with 80 white share are omitted and shaded with the
crosshatch pattern. We report the unweighted and populationweighted correlation coecients between these measures and
the absolute upward mobility measures in Figure VIa across CZs. To construct Panel C, we rst compute upward mobility
in each CZ, restricting the sample to individuals living in ZIP codes that are more than w white, which we denote by yw
25,c.
We then regress yw
25,c on y25,c, our baseline estimates of upward mobility based on the full sample, using an unweighted OLS
regression with one observation per CZ with available data. We vary w from 0 to 95 in increments of 5 and plot the
resulting regression coecients against the fraction of white individuals in each of the subsamples. The condence interval,
shown by the dotted lines around the point estimates, is based on standard errors clustered at the state level. The dashed
diagonal line shows the predicted relationship if there were no spatial heterogeneity in upward mobility conditional on race.

Notes: This gure evaluates the robustness of the rankrank slope to changes in the age at which parent income is measured
(Panel A), the age of the child when parent income is measured (Panel B), and the number of years used to measure the
childs income (Panel C). Panels A and C are based on the core sample (198082 birth cohorts). In Panel A, each point shows
the slope coecient from an OLS regression of child income rank on parent income rank (as in Figure IIa), varying the age at
which parent income rank is measured. The rst point measures parent income in 1996 only, when the mean age of parents is
41. The second point measures parent income in 1997, when parents have a mean age of 42. The last point measures income
in 2010, when parents are 55. Panel B reproduces Appendix Figure 2b from Chetty et al. (2014). In this gure, each point
shows the slope coecient from an OLS regression of an indicator for the child attending college at age 19 on parent income
rank (similar to Figure IVa), varying the year in which parent income rank is measured from 1996 to 2011. In this series, we
use data from the 1993 birth cohort, which allows us to analyze parent income starting when children are 3 years old in 1996.
We list the age of the child on the x axis to evaluate whether the gradient diers when children are young (although parent
age is of course also rising in lockstep). In Panel C, each point shows the slope coecient from the same rankrank regression
as in Panel A using the core sample, but here we always use a veyear (19962000) mean to measure parent income and vary
the number of years used to compute mean child income. The point for one year measures child income in 2012 only. The
point for two years uses mean child income in 201112. We continue adding data for prior years; the 6th point uses mean
income in years 20072012.

Notes: These gures present nonparametric binned scatter plots (shown by the points and solid line, left yaxis) of the
relationship between child and parent income ranks in 20 largest CZs based on population in the 2000 Census. All gures are
based on the core sample (198082 birth cohorts) and baseline family income denitions for parents and children. Children are
assigned to commuting zones based on the location of their parents. Parent and child percentile ranks are always dened at
the national level, not the CZ level. To construct each rankrank series, we group parents into 50 equally sized (two percentile
point) bins and plot the mean child percentile rank vs. the mean parent percentile rank within each bin. Each gure also
shows the fraction of parents with income in each bin divided by the share in that bin in the national income distribution
(dashed curve, right yaxis). The dashed curve averages to one (denoted by the horizontal dashed line in each panel) in each
CZ by construction and depicts the income distribution in the CZ relative to the national distribution.

Estimates of Absolute Upward Mobility Pooling 198082 and 198085 Cohorts
Notes: The gure presents the map of absolute upward mobility by CZ shown on the project homepage (www.equalityof
opportunity.org). For the 709 CZs that have at least 250 children in the 198082 cohorts, we compute absolute upward mobility
exactly as in Figure VIa. For an additional 22 CZs that have fewer than 250 children in the 198082 cohorts but at least
250 children in the 198085 cohorts, we report estimates of absolute upward mobility using the 198085 birth cohorts. We
estimate absolute upward mobility using exactly the same procedure as described in the notes to Figure VIa. The map is
constructed by grouping CZs into ten deciles based on the hybrid absolute mobility measure and shading the areas so that
lighter colors correspond to higher absolute mobility. Areas with fewer that 250 children in the 198085 cohorts are shaded
with the crosshatch pattern.The CZlevel statistics underlying this map are reported in Online Data Table V.

PREFACE
Over the course of the last 35 years the AEG Cities of
The World Committee, under the leadership of Dr. Allen
Hatheway, has sponsored peerreviewed technical papers
following a uniform format of discussion focusing on the
environmental and geologic circumstances that brought
people to settle in the 24 cities making up the series to date.
In addition to the natural resources that brought original in
habitants to settle these regions, the series continues to bring
forth the bevy of geologic conditions that have essential
ly controlled the development and expansion of each city.
As we continue to move forward in the twentyfirst cen
tury, during a time of environmental vigilance, geologists
and engineers will meet and adapt to these same geologic
conditions, in every instance to overcome the challenges of
keeping each city capable of sustaining the presence of its
alwaysexpanding human population.
There is a ritual associated with the Editorship of the
Cities Series, beyond seeking and processing each sub
mitted manuscript. The editorship offers this Preface as a
spotlight on how the generally unique geologic regime of
Pittsburgh and its surrounding area serves as a distinctly dif
ferent blend of the typical geologic features linking Earths
history to todays populated environments.
It is very apparent that the geologic conditions sur
rounding Pittsburgh have been the dominating influence
that led to its founding, formed the basis of its industrial
heritage, and continues to sculpt its modern landscape.
Pittsburgh lies in a geographic region known as the Ap
palachian Plateau, which has a long history of sedimenta
tion, followed by multiple cycles of tectonic construction,
and punctuated by various later sequences of erosion and
deposition associated with Pleistocene glaciation. This
unique series of geologic events bestowed Western Penn
sylvania a riverandridge dominance and endowed it with
plentiful natural resources.
French, British, and early American settlers quickly
recognized the tract of land occupying the confluence of the
Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers as a site of strategic im
portance for providing easy transportation and trade routes
into the heartland of the continent. Pittsburgh came to be
known as the Gateway to the West. Its economic advantage
stems from its position on the northwestern edge of the rich
Appalachian bituminous coal beds, and station at the eastern
headwaters of the extensive Mississippi River system via
the Ohio River Valley. Thus, humans came to regard Pitts
burgh as the best place to congregate west of Philadelphia
and to set up shop for the rising horde of emigrants and oth
er adventurers setting out for the freeland bounties of the
American West.
Harnessing the landscape to take advantage of these
bountiful natural resources and passages west would
become another matter, as western Pennsylvania would
come to be the civil engineers proving ground. Every move
made to set up commerce and industry was highly influenced
by the spaceandplace confined geologic constraints that
derived directly from the riverandridge controls of more
basic tectonic geologic structure. The really great temporal
modifications to the overwhelming magnitude of valleys,
ridges and rivers, have been brought about by the necessary
engineered works that have been sought by the commercial
and industrial activities within the valleys, and the neces
sities of arching transportation (canal, railroad, navigation
improvement and flood control) that have become necessary
to allow the population to earn their livings. The success
or failure of every design for engineered works in and
around the Pittsburgh area established, and has continued
to prove the overwhelming significance of incorporating
the specification of geologic conditions into engineered
designs, the work product of the Engineering Geologist.

ABSTRACT
The City of Pittsburgh is located west of the Appala
chian Mountains in a moderately to deeply dissected portion
of the Appalachian Plateau Province. The relatively flat sur
face of the plateau is dissected by local drainage from the
three principal rivers of the region, the Allegheny, Monon
gahela, and the Ohio. The formation of Pittsburghs three
rivers has a long history dating back to before the Pleisto
cene Period, linked closely to the retreat of continental gla
ciation, and subsequent meltwaters filling the river channels
and eroding the landscape. Pittsburgh was not glaciated;
however, periglacial activity and sandgravel outwash, rep
resent two major results of glaciation that terminated just
north of Pittsburgh.
Western Pennsylvania is associated with the westernmost
formation of the Appalachian Mountain chain. The Allegheny
Orogeny had the most effect on Southwest Pennsylvania. The
4
Geology of Pittsburgh
uplift created a series of nearly flatlying, gently warped Pa
leozoic sedimentary rocks under the region. Rocks outcrop
ping in the Appalachian Plateau vary in age from Devonian
to Permian. Surficial bedrock of Southwest Pennsylvania is
associated with deltaic depositional environments with a cy
clical nature, from fluctuating sea levels. Pennsylvanian stra
ta of the region are dominated by thin cyclic sequences of
sandstone, shale, claystone, coal, and limestone.
Pittsburghs strategic location helped shape the west
ward expansion during the early formation of the Nation,
largely because of the rivers, which served as an inexpen
sive, yet efficient means of transportation. The region was
considered a stronghold for the emerging country because
of its tactical location and later due to its abundance of nat
ural resources. Some of the natural resources include coal,
natural gas, oil, salt, limestone, sand and gravel and water.
Geologic hazards present in Pittsburgh and its surround
ings include, mine subsidence, acid mine drainage, expansive
shales and slags, pyritic acid rock and slope instability. Slope
instability results from low shear strength colluvial deposits
and the local Pittsburgh Redbeds, a notorious claystone re
sponsible for numerous landslides. Because of the regions
steep topography, abundant rainfall, low shear strength
rocks, and soils with low residual strength, landslides have
resulted in major property damage and loss of life.
Infrastructure is significant in Pittsburgh. The City
began and grew because of the natural river systems, sup
plemented by manmade canals. Today, the region has 23
navigation locks and dams. The early system of canals was
later replaced by rail systems for the shipment of bulk com
modities. Allegheny County, the county encompassing Pitts
burgh, has more bridges than any other county in the Nation.
In addition to bridges, the City has eleven tunnels that fa
cilitate vehicular transportation and two locally famous in
clines, which were originally used to transport workers up
and down the steep topographic feature known locally as
Mt. Washington. However, the existing infrastructure of
roads, bridges, tunnels, railways and navigation locks and
dams are aging.
Today, Pittsburgh has transcended the legacy name,
Steel City. Boasting a vibrant downtown, the City has na
tionallyrecognized universities and medical centers. There
is a resurgence in shale natural gas exploration using hydrof
racturing methods. Coal continues to be a dominant energy
source for the numerous coalfired power plants in the re
gion. Many environmental remediation projects are under
way in the region, related to acid mine drainage from legacy
coal mining, reclaiming land areas of former steel mills, and
past production sites of nuclear materials. Maintaining and
replacing Pittsburghs aging infrastructure of roads, bridges,
tunnels, dams and river navigation structures will be a major
challenge and generate work for many years into the future.
INTRODUCTION
Geographic Setting
Although Pittsburgh has a long history as a major in
dustrial center, it occupies a relatively small area, 56 sq.
miles, and has a population (US Census Bureau, 2010) of
approximately 305,000. Pittsburgh is located within Allegh
eny County, which is one of the 67 counties in Pennsylva
nia. The Greater Pittsburgh Region is normally considered
to include Allegheny County and the adjacent Armstrong,
Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland
Counties. These counties comprise 5,343 square miles and
have a population of more than 2.3 million people (US Cen
sus Bureau, 2010).
Pittsburgh is located to the west of the Appalachian
Mountains in a moderately dissected portion of the Appa
lachian Plateau (Figure 1). Here the relatively flat plateau
surface is deeply dissected by the drainage, which has pro
duced steepsided valleys having a relief ranging up to 600
feet. The upland areas generally lie at an elevation greater
than 1,200 feet above mean sea level and constitute only
about ten to twenty percent of the surface area of the region.
Valley slopes account for about fifty to seventy percent of
the area, while the bottomlands constitute twenty percent or
less (Gardner, 1980).

Pittsburgh is located at the confluence of the three larg
est rivers in the region, the Allegheny, Monongahela, and
the Ohio (Figure 1). The Allegheny River flows from the
north, originating in northern Pennsylvania and southern
New York. The Monongahela River flows from the south,
originating in east central West Virginia. The Allegheny
and Monongahela Rivers meet in Pittsburgh, and form the
westward flowing Ohio. The Ohio River is a major artery of
drainage into the interior of the continent, joining the Mis
sissippi River about 930 miles downstream from Pittsburgh
at Cairo, Illinois (Gardner, 1980).
Climate
The Pittsburgh area has four distinct seasons. Fall and
spring are generally warm and mild, summers are hot and
humid with occasional heat waves and winters are cold and
snowy. Based upon 30year averages (NOAA, 2014), the
mean monthly temperatures are warmest in July (72.6 F)
and coldest in January (28.4 F). Pittsburgh averages 9.5
days per year when the temperature reaches 90 F or higher
and 5 days per year when the temperature drops below 0 F.
The highest temperature recorded in Pittsburgh, 103 F, has
occurred on three occasions (July 1881, August 1918 and
July 1988), while the lowest recorded temperature, 22 F,
has occurred once in January 1994.
Average precipitation is 38.2 inches and is relatively
evenly distributed through the year, with the driest month
(October) averaging 2.29 inches of precipitation, and the
wettest month (June) averaging 4.3 inches of precipitation.
Records indicate that the largest oneday snowfall, 23.6
inches, fell on March 13, 1993, and that the largest oneday
rainfall event, 5.95 inches, fell on September 17, 2004 (Hur
ricane Ivan). The second largest rainfall event, 3.6 inches,
fell on September 8, 2004 (Hurricane Frances), only one
week before the Hurricane Ivan rainfall.
History and Founding
The first inhabitants of the Pittsburgh region were prob
ably PaleoIndians who may have occupied the area about
16,000 years ago, as indicated by archaeological findings
at Meadowcroft Rock Shelter located on a small tributary
to the Ohio River about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of
Pittsburgh. The PaleoIndians were huntergatherers who
exploited the abundant animal and plant resources of the re
gion (Gardner, 1980).
The PaleoIndian culture was followed by the Archaic
huntergatherer culture, probably between 7,000 and 8,000
years ago, and the Archaic culture was supplanted by the
Woodland culture about 3,000 years ago when agricul
ture was first introduced in the area. Two moundbuilding
societies developed along the rivers and streams of this
region during the Woodland cultural period. The first were
the Adena moundbuilders, who occupied the region from
about 3,000 to 2,000 years ago before they were displaced
by the more advanced Hopewell culture that lasted from
about 2,000 years ago to 500 A.D. (Gardner, 1980).
It was the strategic location at the confluence of the riv
ers that first attracted the attention of the European colo
nists to the Forks of the Ohio at what is now Pittsburgh.
The conflicts between the British and French in Europe in
the early and mid1700s were transported to North America
as both nations struggled for domination of the continent.
The French claimed the area west of the Allegheny Moun
tains as theirs, including the combined Ohio and Allegheny
Rivers; the English did not recognize these claims. A group
of English colonials from Virginia formed an organization
called the Ohio Land Company, whose members included
Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia and Lawrence Washington,
George Washingtons older brother. The Ohio Land Compa
ny claimed over half a million acres of the area around the
Forks for trade and land speculation, land that the French
had previously claimed as theirs. Ensuing clashes between
the French and English trading in the area prompted Gov
ernor Dinwiddie to send a 21year old major of the Virgin
ia Militia, George Washington, to deliver a protest to the
French (Gardner, 1980).
Enroute, Major Washington travelled by the Forks and
noted:
. . . I spent some time viewing the rivers, and the land
in the Fork which I think extremely well situated for a fort,
as it has absolute command of both rivers . . . the Land at
the point is 20 to 25 feet above the common surface of the
water; and a considerable bottom of flat, welltimbered land
all around it, very convenient for building . . .
(from Washingtons Chronicle, in Lorant, 1975)
The confrontations with the French prompted the Virgin
ians to build a fort at the Forks as suggested by Washington.
Construction of Fort Prince George was initiated in March
1754, and was the first recorded EuroAmerican construction
on the land that is now Pittsburgh. The unfinished colonial
fort was abandoned one month later when a superior force of

(BrooklineConnection.com).

Geology of Pittsburgh
French and Indians threatened attack. The French then erect
ed their own fort, Fort Duquesne, at the Forks. The French
controlled the Forks for four years, repelling several English
attempts to regain control. In November of 1758, the French
burned and abandoned Fort Duquesne in the face of immi
nent attack by British forces headed by General John Forbes
and Colonel George Washington. The English erected their
own fort on the ruins of Fort Duquesne, and Forbes named it
Fort Pitt in honor of the thencurrent English Prime Minister,
William Pitt. Fort Pitt received no attacks from the French,
although it was besieged by Indians for two months during
Pontiacs Conspiracy in 1763. The end of the Indian up
rising reduced the need for Fort Pitt, and it was gradually
dismantled in the mid1760s (Gardner, 1980). Figure 2 shows
Fort Pitt in 1776. A portion of Fort Pitt has been reconstructed
in its original location at what is now Point State Park.
The community that developed around the Fort contin
ued to grow as a center of trade for the ever increasing travel
from east to west, as Pittsburgh developed as a gateway to the
west. Figure 3 shows the locations of Fort Duquesne, Fort Pitt
and Pittsburgh in 1795. When the community was incorporat
ed as a city in 1816, it was the major center for commerce
in the west, since most travel from the eastern seaboard to
the west went through Pittsburgh. Henry Steele Commager, a
noted historian, summarized the situation as follows:
. . . The historical significance of Pittsburgh was deter
mined from the beginning, by geography . . . . The city that
was to rise at this strategic point on the threshold of the
Forks was at once the bridge from the East and the Gateway
to the West, the most western of the great cities of the sea
board, the most eastern of the great cities of the valley: it is
no accident that it has commanded that position now for a
century and a half; its sovereignty unchallenged . . .
(Lorant, 1975)
Pittsburghs economy was primarily based on commerce
in the late 1700s and early 1800s, thereby living up to its
Gateway status. As Pittsburgh grew, it required an ever
increasing supply of goods, most of which were manufac
tured in the east. However, transporting large quantities of
trade goods and pioneer supplies was incredibly difficult and
expensive because the rugged Appalachian Mountain ridges
between Pittsburgh and lands to the east were a formidable
barrier. For this reason, Pittsburgh was forced to develop its
own manufacturing industry, and by 1815, it was producing
significant quantities of iron, brass, tin and glass products.
By 1830, the tradecommerce aspect of Pittsburghs economy
was eclipsed by manufacturing. Thus, Pittsburgh was found
ed and began to flourish as a center of commerce and manu
facturing because of its geography. But Pittsburgh was only
born of its geography; it owes most of its growth and eventual
status as a leading industrial center to its geology (Gardner,
1980). In 1901, U.S. Steel Corporation was formed in Pitts
burgh, and by 1911, the city was the nations eighth largest,
producing between a third and a half of the nations steel.
The most important factors affecting the growth of Pitts
burgh were the mineral resources of the region, including
Figure 3. Map of Pittsburgh  1795 (Albert, 1896).
7
Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
coal, oil, natural gas, some iron ore, and the availability of
attendant requirements such as water, building materials,
power, transportation capabilities, and marketability. How
ever, the single most important resource to affect Pittsburghs
growth and industrial stature was coal (Gardner, 1980).
There are two significant coals, the Pittsburgh and Up
per Freeport seams that are mined in the Pittsburgh Region
(Figure 11). They are two of at least thirteen coal seams that
have been strip mined andor deep mined at one place or
another in the region.
The Pittsburgh Coal is considered to be one of the rich
est economic deposits in the world. The U.S. Geological
Survey estimated that the Pittsburgh Coal alone yielded
eight billion tons from the early 1900s to 1965, comprising
thirtyfive percent of all bituminous coal in the Appalachian
Basin and twentyone percent of the cumulative production
for the entire United States. The Pittsburgh Coal is essen
tially workedout and no longer deepmined in Pittsburgh
(Gardner, 1980) but it is still mined in the southwest corner
of the state where the seam is much deeper.
The Upper Freeport Coal lies about 660 feet below the
Pittsburgh Coal and has been deepmined in a northsouth
belt east of the city and just north of the city. However, it is
relatively thin and is not deepmined under the city.
The first record of coal mining in Pittsburgh was made
by Captain Thomas Hutchins in 1759 when he noted a coal
mine on the hillside across the Monongahela River from
Pittsburgh. The mine was developed in the coal outcrop by
the British soldiers on Coal Hill, which is now called Mt.
Washington. Coal was mined on a small scale until indus
trialization created a greater fuel demand by the mid1800s.
The principal user of coal in the Pittsburgh region was the
iron and steel industry. The iron industry began almost at the
birth of the community. The first iron furnace reported in Pitts
burgh was built on Two Mile Run (Shadyside) in 1793, and
closed after only one year of operation for lack of local timber
for fuel and iron ore. Although Pittsburghs first iron furnace
was unsuccessful, numerous furnaces operating in outlying ar
eas closer to the local ore deposits did succeed. Because Pitts
burgh was the center of commerce, trade, labor and marketing,
the industry took advantage of these resources, and local iron
forging became a lucrative business (Gardner, 1980).
REGIONAL GEOLOGY
Physiography
The physiographic provinces of Pennsylvania are
subdivided into regions that generally have a similar geo
logic structure, geomorphic history and climate. Pennsylva
nia is divided into six physiographic provinces according
to the Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. Additionally, these
six provinces are made up of smaller sections, which them
selves have unique characteristics. Figure 4 presents the
Pennsylvania Physiographic Province Map provided by the
Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Re
sources (PA DCNR), (Sevon, 2000).
The Pittsburgh region is part of the upland area of the
Appalachian Plateau Province. This upland area is a rela
tively flat surface with deeply dissected drainage that has
produced steepsided valleys with vertical relief on the or
der of 600 feet along the major drainages. The terrain is a
dissected mature landscape developed on gently folded
to essentially flatlying sedimentary strata. In southwest
Pennsylvania the structural geologic trends are northeast to
southwest. The province is bounded to the southeast by the
Valley and Ridge Province and to the northwest by the Cen
tral Lowlands Province.
The Appalachian Plateau Province in southwest Penn
sylvania is divided into the Pittsburgh Low Plateau Section,
Waynesburg Hills Section and the Allegheny Mountain Sec
tion. The City of Pittsburgh is located in two of the sections,
with the Pittsburgh Low Plateau Section to the north and the
Waynesburg Hills Section to the south, as shown in Figure 4.
The Pittsburgh Low Plateau Section has a smooth to
undulating surface composed of narrow and relatively shal
low valleys having a dendritic drainage pattern. It has low
to moderate relief with the underlying rock composed most
ly of shale, siltstone, and sandstone. The geologic structure
consists of moderate to low amplitude folds that decrease in
occurrence in a northwestward direction.
The Waynesburg Hills Section is comprised of relative
ly hilly terrain with narrow hilltops and steepsloped narrow
valleys with a dendritic drainage pattern. It has moderate
relief with underlying rock types of shale, sandstone, lime
stone, red shale and claystone. The geologic structure rang
es from low amplitude folds to horizontal bedding.
A small portion of the northwest section of the Appa
lachian Plateau was glaciated during the Pleistocene Epoch,
with the closest approach of Wisconsinian ice about 30 miles
north of the city. This was the last ice advance in the area.
Tectonic Setting
The tectonic history of western Pennsylvania is asso
ciated with the westernmost formation of the Appalachian
Mountain chain. Four different tectonic episodes produced
the Appalachian Mountain chain. A geologic time scale of
the major geologic events is shown in Figure 5.
The three earliest tectonic events are the Grenville
Orogeny, Taconic Orogeny, and the Acadian Orogeny.
These events had little effect on Pittsburgh and the south
west Pennsylvania area.
The fourth and final mountain building event, the Al
legheny Orogeny, did affect southwest Pennsylvania. This
event began approximately 300 million years ago during the
Pennsylvanian Period, and extended into the Permian Period
(Hatcher, 2004). It resulted from the collision between the
North American and African plates. Southwest Pennsylva
nia received much less deformation due to its distance from
8

the collision area. The major effects were gentle folding of
the in place rocks, creating minor anticlines and synclines
triggered by deeper thrustfaulting (Schultz et al., 2013).
Southwest Pennsylvania has experienced multiple
cycles of tectonic construction followed by erosion and
deposition. Sedimentation in the northern Appalachians is
considered complex with both basinwide and local factors
controlling deposition. The depositional area of the Al
legheny Plateau in western Pennsylvania is part of a major
structural basin referred to as the Appalachian Coal Basin,
or Allegheny Synclinorium. The northern portion is often
referred to as the PittsburghHuntington Basin or the Dunk
ard Basin, depending on the location. A section through the
Allegheny Synclinorium is presented in Figure 6.
During the Appalachian tectonic events, eroded sedi
ment was transported generally westward from the ancestral
Appalachians. Figure 7 illustrates the paleogeography of the
basin and source area. An evaluation of sediment deposition
into this basin identifies multiple sequence events. This se
quencing was in conjunction with sea level conditions in
southwest Pennsylvania. See Figure 5 for a timescale of
the major activities affecting the Pennsylvania region and
subsequent rock deposits associated with the activity. A
generalized depositional history of the rocks in southwest
Pennsylvania, starting at the base of the stratigraphic col
umn and progressing upward to the surficial rocks of the
PennsylvanianPermian Period, is as follows (Slingerland
and Beaumont, 1989):

tional environments associated with some of the rock units.
Geologic Setting
Rock strata outcropping in the Appalachian Plateau
vary in age from Devonian to Permian as shown in Figure
9, the Geologic Map of Pennsylvania. Devonian age rocks
outcrop north of Pittsburgh. Mississippian age strata also
outcrop north of Pittsburgh, as well as on the ridges east
of Pittsburgh. Rocks of Pennsylvanian age form the surface
strata within the Pittsburgh area. Permian age rock outcrops
southwest of Pittsburgh.
The structural trend of the Appalachian Plateau ranges
from North 30 East to North 70 East (Amdt et al., 1969).
The lengths of the anticlines and synclines vary significantly,
as shown in Figure 10. The dip associated with these folded
structures is generally no more than a few degrees. Pennsylva
nian strata are characterized by thin cyclic sequences of sand
stone, shale, claystone, coal, and limestone (Philbrick, 1953,
1959, 1960). The most readily identifiable and consistent rock
strata are the coal beds and some limestone beds.
Faulting is not common, but some minor localized
vertical displacements are present.
Stratigraphy
Sedimentary Rock
The surface and nearsurface rock in the greater Pitts
burgh area belong to the Permian and Pennsylvanian age
Dunkard Group and the Pennsylvanian age Monongahela,
Conemaugh and Allegheny Groups. A generalized strati
graphic column of the Pittsburgh region is presented in
Figure 11. Locations of counties are identified on the Geolog
ic Map of Pennsylvania in Figure 9. A generalized summary
of these rock types follows:
Dunkard Group  Permian and Pennsylvanian
This group occurs near the surface in central and south
ern Washington County, which is southwest of the City of
Pittsburgh (See Figure 9). The Dunkard reaches a maxi
mum thickness of about 1120 feet (Berryhill et al., 1971)
in Greene County and the upper surface is the modern day
erosional surface. It is generally composed of finegrained
clastics which are frequently calcareous. The lower bound
ary of the Dunkard Group is defined as the base of the
Figure 5. Geologic Time Scale of Major Geologic Events in Pennsylvania (Barnes and Sevon, 2002).
10
Geology of Pittsburgh
Waynesburg Coal, which is the only coal routinely mined in
the Dunkard. It is made up of the Waynesburg, Washington
and Greene Formations (Berryhill et al., 1971). The basal
Waynesburg Formation consists of shale, sandstone, silt
stone, and coal. The overlying Washington Formation out
crops in valley bottoms in the northwest corner of Greene
County and consists of limestone, claystone, siltstone,
sandstone, carbonaceous shale, and coal. Thick lacustrine
limestones are especially prevalent in the Washington For
mation. The uppermost Greene Formation, which covers
the western half of Greene County and caps the tops of
ridges in the eastern part of the county, consists mostly of
shale, sandstone, siltstone, and limestone.
Monongahela Group  Pennsylvanian
The Monongahela Group underlies the Waynesburg
Group, extending from the base of the Waynesburg Coal to
the base of the Pittsburgh Coal, as shown in Figure 11. The
Group includes the Uniontown and Pittsburgh Formations. It
is a nonmarine sedimentary sequence. Coal seams, includ
ing the Uniontown, Sewickley, Redstone and the Pittsburgh
Coals, are persistent and are the primary marker beds in the
area. This group ranges in thickness between 275 and 290
feet (Berryhill et al., 1971). It consists of cyclic sedimentary
sequences formed in a relatively low energy, marginal upper
delta plain having extensive lake and swamp development
(Berryhill et al., 1971; Donaldson, 1974). The depositional
environments of the coals are identified as tropical swamps
in anaerobic conditions.
The Uniontown Formation contains both an upper and
lower member separated by the Little Waynesburg Coal. The
Upper Member is shale or very thinly bedded sandstone.
The Lower Member is mostly sandstone with interbedded
coal lenses near its base.
The Pittsburgh Formation contains several coal seams,
including the laterally extensive Pittsburgh Coal, which is the
basal member of the Pittsburgh Formation. The Pittsburgh
Formation is divided into five members: the lower member;
Redstone; Fishpot; Sewickley; and the upper member. This
formation consists of numerous relatively persistent limestone
seams and lesser claystone beds in the upper portion with the
lower portion predominately shale, sandstone and coal seams.
The lower member includes the approximately 10foot
thick, persistent Pittsburgh Coal, overlain by the only clastic
rock within the Pittsburgh Formation, the Pittsburgh Sand
stone. The Pittsburgh Sandstone is a persistent fluvial unit
that is generally thinly bedded to massive. A major fluvial
channel system, flowing north to northwest through what is
now Greene and Washington Counties, deposited this unit
as an elongated sandstone body up to 80 feet thick and sev
eral miles wide (Edmunds et al., 1999).
The Redstone Member is stratigraphically above the
lower member and is characterized by siltstone and clay
stone and includes a persistent limestone unit. The division
between the lower member and the Redstone Member is

the Late Pennsylvanian when the rocks of Pittsburgh were

typically marked by the Redstone Coal; however, the coal is
laterally discontinuous.
The Fishpot Member, the next stratigraphic unit within the
Pittsburgh Formation, is the thinnest unit. The Fishpot includes
mainly siltstone and claystone with several thin sandstone bod
ies. This formation can be difficult to identify where the Fish
pot Coal is absent because it marks the base of the Fishpot.
The Sewickley Member represents the thickest lime
stone sequence, the Benwood Limestone. The Benwood
Limestone is a relatively thick interbedded limestone and
shale unit that is dolomitic in portions of the region.
The thick upper member of the Pittsburgh Formation
contains four limestone units designated in ascending order
as A, B, C, and D. These rather persistent limestone
seams are interbedded with siltstone and shale seams that
are generally in proportion with the thickness of the lime
stone found above these finegrained seams. Limestones of
the Monongahela Group are freshwater limestones, deposit
ed during highstands in the lakes of alluvial plains.
Conemaugh Group  Pennsylvanian
The Conemaugh Group underlies the Monongahela Group
in southwest Pennsylvania. This sedimentary group includes
the Glenshaw and Casselman Formations, and is a clastic se
quence dominated by siltstone, claystone, shale and sandstone.
The average thickness of this group is approximately 620 feet
(Schultz, 1999), and extends from the base of the Pittsburgh
Coal to the top of the Upper Freeport Coal. Bedrock exposure
of the Conemaugh Group is limited in southwest Pennsylva
nia, with most exposures at and north of Pittsburgh.
The Conemaugh stratigraphy is subdivided into two dis
tinct formations (Flint, 1965) based upon marine units, with the
boundary between them being the top of the persistent Ames
limestone. The upper unit, the Casselman Formation, is essen
tially devoid of marine units, while the lower unit, the Glen
shaw Formation, contains widespread marine units (Schultz,
1999). Mineable coals are not common in the Conemaugh.
The Casselman Formation extends from the base of the
Pittsburgh coal to the base of the Ames Limestone and con

Geology of Pittsburgh
sists of a sequence of alternating layers of sandstone, shale,
red beds (claystone), limestone and thin discontinuous coal
seams. The Ames Limestone is a laterally continuous fos
siliferous limestone that is generally on the order of two
to four feet thick. It serves as the primary marker bed in
the Conemaugh Group, and identifies the youngest marine
transgression in southwest Pennsylvania.
The Birmingham Shale is a significant unit within the
Casselman Formation. It is generally described as a dark,
thinly laminated rock nearly 50 feet thick that occurs below
the Morgantown sandstone, and about 30 to 60 feet above
the Ames Limestone in Pittsburgh. It consists mainly of
finegrained siltstone and shale overbank deposits. Marine
fossils have been found in the shale outcrops at Birmingham
Station (just west of Pittsburgh). This transition zone con
tains marine to brackish fauna and represents the last marine
episode of the Paleozoic in Pennsylvania.
The Glenshaw Formation extends from the base of the
Ames Limestone to the top of the Upper Freeport Coal. The
claystones and shales are the weaker units. These weaker
members are notorious for landslide potential. All of these
rock units are commonly interbedded and tend to change
lithologically over short lateral distances.
A primary source in southwest Pennsylvania for land
slides is the Pittsburgh Red Beds, which is near the top of the
Glenshaw Formation. It is a 40 to 60 foot series of mostly
reddish, greenish, and grayish claystone and shale, with mi
nor amounts of sandstone and siltstone that tend to weather
deeply on hillsides throughout southwestern Pennsylvania.
Claystone is a low permeability, low strength rock with
weakly connected pore space. Repeated weathering cycles
and excessive pore pressure have a tendency to reduce the in
ternal shear strength of this particular rock, which can lead to
failure. In addition, Conemaugh claystones contain minerals
that tend to expand in the presence of water (Pomeroy, 1982).
These red shales have been interpreted as a paleosol
horizon (ancient soil zone) on the Pennsylvanian delta by
Donahue and Rollins (1974). They suggest that the red col
or and the claystone texture are similar to that of a laterite
soil weathering profile. Good exposures of the series can
display evidence of an ancient soil development with some
occasional root casts and calciterich nodules.
Allegheny Group  Pennsylvanian
The Allegheny Group underlies the Conemaugh with a
thickness between 270 and 330 feet in western Pennsylvania
(Edmunds et al., 1999) beginning at the top of the Upper Free
port Coal and extending to the base of the Brookville Coal.
This group consists largely of marine units and contains six
mineable coals, referred to as the Upper Freeport Coal, Low
er Freeport Coal, Upper Kittanning Coal, Middle Kittanning
Coal, Lower Kittanning Coal and the Brookville Coal. These
coals outcrop north of the Pittsburgh area. Coals and associ
ated strata of the lower Allegheny Group (Brookville through

Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
Middle Kittanning coals) were deposited during a general
eastward marine transgression. The setting was a shifting
complex of marine to brackish embayments, lowerdeltaplain
distributaries, and interdistributary to coastal margin swamps,
grading inland to an upperdeltaplain fluvial and interfluvial
swamp system (Williams, 1960; Williams and Ferm, 1965;
Ferm and Cavaroc, 1969; Ferm, 1970, 1974). The upper Al
legheny Group (Upper Kittanning through Upper Freeport
coals) was deposited in a relatively high energy, upperdel
taplain fluvial and interfluvial lake and swamp environment
during a period of general marine regression (Sholes et al.,
1979; Skema et al., 1982).
The Allegheny Group contains a repeating succession of
coal, limestone, and clastics, ranging from claystone to coarse
sandstone. Most beds exhibit lithologic change both vertical
ly and laterally over short distances, but some coals, a few
marine shales and limestones are continuous over large areas.
Pottsville Group  Pennsylvanian
The Pennsylvanian age Pottsville Formation is a major
ridgeformer in the RidgeandValley Province of the east
ern United States and along the Allegheny Front, the east
facing escarpment of the Appalachian Plateau. The Formation
ranges in thickness from 100 feet to 1,600 feet (Edmunds,
1999). The Pottsville Formation consists predominately of a
wellcemented cobble and pebble conglomerate with some
sandstones and finer clastics and coal (Edmunds, 1999) that
range in thickness from about 10 to 70 feet. It extends upward
from the top of the Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation to
the base of the underclay beneath the Brookville coal of the
Allegheny Formation. Abrupt variations in the thickness of
the Pottsville of up to 100 feet have been observed in short
distances, with this variability mainly occurring in the basal
part of the formation (McElroy, 2000). The formation has mi
nor marine limestones in northern Pennsylvania. Mining of
coal in the Pottsville is limited. Because it contains resistant
rock units, it tends to form ridges and cap most of the high
points, including Mount Davis (3,213 feet), the highest point
in Pennsylvania, which is located in Somerset County.
Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks
Precambrian basement rock (See Figure 12) underlies all
of Pennsylvania, but is only exposed in the southeastern part
of the state. A thick Paleozoic sequence overlies the basement
for all of southwest Pennsylvania. The depth of the basement
rocks directly under the Pittsburgh region is inferred from
deep wells located in northwestern Pennsylvania, eastern
Ohio and northwestern West Virginia.
The basement in the Pittsburgh region is at a depth rang
ing from 14,700 to 16,400 feet according to the Geology of
Pennsylvania (Saylor, 1999), and is believed to have lithol
ogies similar to the Canadian Grenville belt. The most com
mon lithologies identified are granite, gneiss, biotite granite
and biotite schist (Saylor, 1999), and all of these lithologies
have been metamorphosed to the greenschist or amphibole
facies (Bass 1959, 1960; Saylor, 1968).
Some indirect evidence has been found that deformation
of the basement exists; however, little physical information
is available. Investigation and research into the basement
is prohibited by the depth to this horizon, and most remote
sensing data remains confidential for the increasing gas
exploration from the recent Middle Devonian shale gas
boom. There are no surface metamorphic rocks in western
Pennsylvania.
The only near surface igneous rock in western Penn
sylvania are two Jurassic kimberlite dikes. The first is the
GatesAdah Dikes, which outcrop near the Monongahela
River on the border of Fayette and Greene Counties (south
of Pittsburgh), shown in Figure 9. The GatesAdah kim
berlite intruded approximately 170 million years ago (Bik
erman et al., 1997), appears to have formed at a relatively
shallow depth and contains mostly pyrope garnets and Alex
andriteeffect pyropes.
The other kimberlite intrusion is the DixonvilleTanoma
Dikes in central Indiana County (northeast of Pittsburgh) as
Figure 12. Subsurface Rocks below Western Pennsylvania
(Adapted from Flaherty  and Flaherty, 2014; and Wagner
et al., 1970).

Geology of Pittsburgh
shown in Figure 9. These dikes are not exposed on the sur
face, but were discovered in the Tanoma Coal Mine while
mining the Upper Freeport Coal. One of the dikes is about
15 inches wide and extends thousands of feet laterally. The
coal mine has closed and the dike is no longer accessible.
Surficial Geologic and Soil Features
Existing and past climatic conditions have resulted in
substantial mechanical and chemical weathering, which
produced a residual or colluvial soil mantle over the rocks
of the Pittsburgh region. The sedimentary rock strata are
normally not exposed, other than in valley walls and exca
vations into rock. There is considerable evidence that rocks
of this region remain highly stressed, and subsequent stress
relief due to valley cutting aids in the physical breakup of
rock and enhances its susceptibility to chemical weathering
(Ferguson, 1967, 1974; V oight, 1974). The most important
discontinuities within the surficial rock are joints. Both tec
tonic and stressrelief jointing are recognized. Both system
atic and nonsystematic jointing occurs, with the majority of
nonsystematic joints in the weaker, finegrained rock.
Joints caused by the local release of residual stress are
closely spaced (up to 10 feet) whereas joints caused by tec
tonic stresses exhibit a spacing of many feet (Nickelsen and
Hough, 1967). The finergrained rocks have more closely
spaced joints. Nickelsen and Hough (1967) present details
of joint patterns, trends and spacing in the Appalachian Pla
teau of Pennsylvania.
Southwestern Pennsylvania is dominated by soil de
rived from acidic shales and sandstones consisting of clay
sized particles with moderate to substantial amounts of rock
fragments. The surficial soils are predominantly silty loams,
which are usually welldrained. This region has relatively
steep slopes, making erosion a major concern. The available
waterholding capacity (i.e. porosity) of many soils in the re
gion is relatively moderate. Residual soils are characteristic
of the flat upland surfaces and flat surfaces of larger benches,
with colluvial soils forming the slopes. In general, the thick
ness of residual or colluvial soils in the Pittsburgh region is
on the order of 10 to 30 feet. Alluvial soils fill stream and
river valleys and reach thicknesses of up to 100 feet.
Pleistocene Glaciation
Pittsburgh has never been glaciated. However, perigla
cial activity and sand and gravel outwash are two major re
sults of glaciation that occurred north of Pittsburgh. Figure 13
shows the limit of glaciation in Western Pennsylvania and the
present river systems. Extensive periglacial activity south of
the glacial limits, consisting of cold wet weather and frequent
freezethaw cycles, impacted the Pittsburgh area. This severe
climate caused extensive mass wasting through rock breakup
and downslope movement of broken material. Peltier (1950)
and Denny (1956) found fossil periglacial features close to
the front of the maximum advance of Wisconsinian glacia
tions in Pennsylvania which strongly supports Pleistocene
periglacial processes influencing development of slopes.
Radiocarbon dating of wood from several large colluvi
al slide masses in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia
indicate a Pleistocene age, and thus a periglacial origin, for
these deposits (Gray et al., 1979).
Wisconsinian glaciation significantly altered the cours
es of the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers, and glacial outwash
filled the valleys with sand and gravel. Erosion subsequent
ly removed approximately 80 feet of the sand and gravel,
leaving about 50 feet of alluvium which created a significant
aquifer in the river valleys. The alluvium consists of hard,
dense sand and gravel which provides excellent foundation
conditions for large buildings and heavy structures along
with a high quality source of durable sand and gravel.
Pittsburgh s Three Rivers
Prior to the Pleistocene glaciation, which began approx
imately 800,000 to 1,000,000 years ago, the Monongahela
River was the dominant river in southwestern Pennsylvania
(Figure 14). It flowed north to the site of Pittsburgh in a
channel approximately coincident with its present channel.
From Pittsburgh, it followed the channel of the present Ohio
River to Beaver, PA where it turned north up the present
Beaver River Valley and flowed north into the Ancestral
Erie Basin (Harper, 1997). This Monongahela River sys

tem drained about threefourths of the area in Pennsylvania
that is presently drained by the combined Ohio, Mononga
hela, and Allegheny Rivers and their tributaries (Harper,
2002). The Ohio River was a tributary of the Monongahela.
It originated south of Moundsville, WV and flowed north,
joining the Monongahela River just south of New Castle,
Pennsylvania. The Allegheny River was three separate riv
ers that drained different parts of Pennsylvania (Figure 14).
The Lower Allegheny originated in Elk, Forest and Jeffer
son Counties, and followed the course of the present Clarion
River, and then flowed south to join the Monongahela River
at what is now Pittsburgh. The Middle Allegheny started
in Warren County and followed a course through Oil City
to Franklin, where it turned northwest along what is now
French Creek and flowed across Crawford and Erie Coun
ties into the Ancestral Erie Basin. The Upper Allegheny
began in northern Pennsylvania and southern New York,
and flowed from Olean to Dunkirk, New York into the An
cestral Erie Basin (Harper, 1997).
During the last Ice Age there were four major advances
and retreats of continental ice sheets in North America. At
least two of these ice sheets, the Illinoian and Wisconsinian,
extended into western Pennsylvania and disrupted drainage
patterns, forming the present streams (See Figure 13). None
of the continental glaciers reached Pittsburgh. The advancing
ice sheets blocked the northwestflowing streams, creating
lakes within the existing drainage areas. As the ponded wa
ters rose, they eventually crested and eroded notches in their
drainage divides. The escaping waters formed new drainage
channels that flowed southwestward, closely paralleling the
front of the glaciers. The three Allegheny Rivers coalesced
to form one, and the Ohio became the major stream of west
ern Pennsylvania, flowing south and then west along the
boundary of the ice to the Mississippi River (Harper, 2002).
The Allegheny and Ohio Rivers subsequently served as the
major channels for the flow of glacial meltwaters.
The relatively flat hilltops in the Pittsburgh areas are
500 to 600 feet above river levels. In Tertiary time, down
cutting of streams produced a system of broad valleys 350
to 400 feet below the hilltops and 200 feet above present
river levels. This preglacial erosional stage produced valley
levels known as the Parker Strath (a Scottish word meaning
a wide flat valley) (Heyman, 1970).
During the Illinoian stage of glaciation the ancestral
Allegheny River was choked with glacial outwash, result
ing in the ponding of tributary streams. To the south, the
Monongahela and Youghiogheny River basins alluvium is
known as the Carmichaels Formation. Figure 15 presents
idealized valley cross sections showing erosion levels and
valley fill deposits in Allegheny County. Following Illinoian
glaciation, active stream erosion cut down 250 feet below
the gravelcovered Parker Strath, excavating channels to a
depth of 50 feet or more below present stream levels (Figure
15). Figure 16 shows the development of the Allegheny and
Monongahela River valleys in the last one million years.
In cutting new channels, the streams locally took com
pletely new courses, leaving behind great channel loops
and meander cutoffs which cross and recross the present
valleys high above present stream level. Today, these wide
valleys do not contain major streams.
Abandoned channels and high level terraces in the imme
diate vicinity of Pittsburgh are shown by Figure 17. A major
abandoned channel (one mile wide) leaves the Monongahela

Valley between Braddock and Swissvale and extends through
Swissvale, Wilkinsburg, East Liberty and the Oakland section
of Pittsburgh before rejoining the Monongahela River Val
ley. Today, this abandoned channel is occupied by the Penn
sylvania Railroad main line and several principal eastwest
roadways, and is the only direct natural overland route toward
downtown Pittsburgh from the east (Heyman, 1970). Exca
vations anywhere in this valley reveal layers of silt and sand,
deposited by the Old Monongahela. Excavations for the
University of Pittsburghs Cathedral of Learning (skyscraper)

ders, along with laminated plastic clay (Leighton, 1947).
As noted previously, the alluvium of the Allegheny and
Ohio valleys, in Allegheny County, consists largely of gla
Figure 16. Development of Allegheny and Monongahela River
Valleys in the Past One Million Years. (Harper, 1997)
A. Before the first glaciation about 770,000 years ago,
the rivers flowed in shallow valleys amid lowrelief plains.
B. During the early (Nebraskan?) glaciation (about 770,000
years ago), increased runoff helped carve the river channels
deeper while filling the Allegheny Valley with glaciallyderived
sand and gravel. C. Following the initial glaciation, the rivers
began to cut downward and laterally into bedrock as the land
began to rise. During successive glaciations, this created a
single, very wide valley at presentday Pittsburgh and left
remnants of the old river valley floors 200 to 250 feet above the
present river level. D. During the late (Wisconsinan) glaciation
(about 75,000 to 10,000 years ago), the Allegheny River cut
down a little more and filled the entire valley with glacially
derived sand and gravel. Since that time, the river banks and
downtown Pittsburgh have been covered only with locally
derived, nonglacial river sediment.

cial outwash gravel and sand and is the primary source of
groundwater in Allegheny County. Pebbles of crystalline
rock transported from considerable distances north of the
area are found included with pebbles of resistant sandstone
of local origin in these valley deposits. The finer material is
likewise of both remote and local origin. Most of the com
mercial gravel deposits in the vicinity of Pittsburgh will
pass a 2inch screen, but boulders are not uncommon. The
material is well sorted in some places, but more common
ly the grain size varies considerably. Figure 18 presents 12
large bulk grain size distribution curves for the glacial grav
els from a deep excavation on the North side of the Ohio
River in Pittsburgh. On average, gravel constitutes over 60
percent (by weight) of the glacial outwash.
The average maximum thickness of the valley alluvium
is about 60 feet. Normally, glacial sand and gravel consti
tutes the basal part of the alluvium and is overlain by recent
flood plain deposits ranging in thickness from 0 to 25 feet. In
parts of the present stream bed, the topmost member of the
alluvium is a layer of very fine silt which, to some extent,
is transitory and is probably scoured during floods and rede
posited as high water stages decline. Characteristic sections
across the Allegheny and Ohio Valleys are shown in Figure
19. Laterally, these alluvial deposits extend the width of the
preWisconsinian stream valleys, which are wider than the
present streams. Generally, the bedrock floor of the valleys is
relatively flat, except in a few areas in the upper Ohio River
where shallow channels were cut into the bedrock floor before
the valley aggraded. In Allegheny County, the thickness of
waterbearing sand and gravel remains fairly constant across
the valleys; however, the sediments thin rapidly near the val
ley walls (Adamson et al., 1949). Figure 20 shows contours
of the rock surface below Pittsburghs downtown area, and
the approximate eastern limit of water bearing glacial gravel.
The old valley bedrock floor on the Allegheny River,
which declines from elevation 682 feet above sea level at
Tarentum to 661.5 feet immediately above the junction
of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers (Pittsburghs
Point), averages a gradient of 1 foot per mile. Continuing
down the Ohio 13 miles from the Point, the ancient valley
floor is found at an elevation of 651 feet, and the average
gradient is 0.8 feet per mile over this distance. At no place
in the Allegheny and Ohio Valleys in the county has bedrock
been recorded at a depth in excess of 85 feet below the av
erage river level.
Within Allegheny County the maximum thickness of
the Monongahela Valley alluvium is 65 feet. The preWis
consinian age Monongahela Valley Floor has a gradient of
about 0.8 feet per mile from Elizabeth, PA to the Point which
is a distance of about 23 miles (Adamson et al., 1949).
NATURAL RESOURCES
Salt, Oil and Natural Gas
Salt was an early high value mineral and was much
sought after on the frontier. It was expensive to haul over the
mountains from the east coast and therefore local sources
were sought and established. It was originally obtained by
evaporating naturally occurring saline brine discharges in
springs in the area. The process was simple, settlers would
dig holes and the holes would fill with brine which was col
lected and kettleevaporated to obtain the crystalline salt
residue. Later wells were drilled for salt, which frequently
tapped the sandstones in the Pottsville Group which became
known as salt sands.
Crude oil was occasionally found in conjunction with the
brine in the salt wells and was originally considered a nui
sance to be discarded. Samuel Kier (ExplorePAhistory.com,

homeopathic cures for various illnesses, and began collecting
and bottling the oil and selling it as a cureall. In 1849, he
opened a bottling and merchandising house in Pittsburgh, and
his Kiers Rock Oil sold throughout the northeastern United
States (See Poster, Figure 21). The oil was sold at the pricey
rate of 50 cents (a days wages) for a half pint bottle and the
label read, Kiers petroleum or rock oil. Celebrated for its
wonderful curative powers. A natural remedy. Procured from
a well in Allegheny (County), Pa. four hundred feet below
the earths surface. (Richardson, 1932). He also began to
experiment with the crude oil as an illuminant and sold the
carbon oil from a warehouse in Pittsburgh. In order to cap
italize on his discovery, he built the first commercial petro
leum refinery in Pittsburgh in 1854 to produce illuminating
oil from the crude oil he obtained from the family salt wells.
Kier was forced to move his refinery operation out of the city
because of local residents fear of fire and explosions.
Once it was determined that the rock oil had a use, it
was collected from the salt wells and from crude oil seeps.
In those areas pits were dug to collect the oil which was
removed and containerized for subsequent sale. Commer
cial oil production began in Pennsylvania with the drilling
of the Drake discovery well in 1859 (See Figure 22). The
well was drilled near Titusville, Venango County, Pennsyl
vania, which is located about 100 miles north of Pittsburgh,
and was the nations first economicallyviable well drilled
intentionally to produce commercially valuable crude oil
(Carter and Flaherty, 2011). Oil exploration slowly moved
south, and in 1886, the Mt. Nebo Field was discovered in
nearby Ohio Township, Allegheny County. The slow south
ward movement of oil recovery activity was due primarily to
the increasing depths of the oil bearing Venango sandstones.
The Drake well was drilled in an area of known oil seeps,
and had a final depth of about 69 feet. Oilbearing Venango
sandstones in that area were no more than 100 feet deep. The
Venango sandstones in the Pittsburgh area are at depths of
between 1,200 feet and 2,800 feet. Such depths required the
development of new exploratory and developmental drilling
equipment and techniques. Between 1886 and 1904, almost
all of the shallow oil fields in Allegheny County had been
found and exploited and the local oil industry started to de
cline. Pittsburgh profited by more than just the oil from the
wells because it was the largest industrialized city near the
new oil fields. By the 1870s, there were more than fifty oil
refineries operating in the area with a total production of
more than 35,000 barrels of oil per day (Gardner, 1980).

Geology of Pittsburgh
The nations first commercial gas well, the Haymaker
well in Murrysville, PA, about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh,
was drilled in 1878. Gas from that well was piped into Pitts
burgh in 1883, which was at the technical limit of such pipe
lines for that time.
Figure 23 shows the general areaextent of traditional
oil and gas, and shale gas reservoirs in Pennsylvania. Lim
ited amounts of gas and oil from these shallow Missis
sippian and Devonian sandstones are still produced in the
area from some of the early wells. A number of the depleted
gas and oil fields in the area are now utilized as gas storage
fields by some of the regional gas companies.
In recent years the industry has seen a rebirth with the
development of natural gas from deeper sources. The source
currently being developed is the Middle Devonian Marcellus
Shale, which is at a depth of around 6,000 feet in the Pittsburgh
area. Much news attention is given to the Marcellus Shale, as it
is thought to contain about 50 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
and is recovered using fracking techniques, which are being
widely debated in regard to possible environmental impacts
associated with development. Another recently identified natu
ral gas source in the area is the Upper Ordovician Utica Shale,
which underlies the Marcellus Shale and has a corresponding
ly larger lateral extent. The Utica in the Pittsburgh area lies at
a depth of about 10,000 feet to 12,000 feet. It is estimated to
contain about 38 trillion cubic feet of yetundiscovered, techni
cally recoverable natural gas (at the mean estimate) according
to the first assessment of this continuous (unconventional) nat
ural gas accumulation by the U. S. Geological Survey (Schenk
et al., 2012). The Utica Shale has a corresponding mean esti

Coal
Pennsylvania is located at the northern end of the Appa
lachian Coal Basin. Coal beds underlie about 15,000 square
miles of the State (See Figure 24). All significant coal beds
in Pennsylvania are of Pennsylvanian or Permian age. Prior
to any mining, Pennsylvania contained over 75 billion tons
of bituminous coal and almost 23 billion tons of anthracite
and semianthracite coal (Edmunds, 1999a).
Early Coal Mining
Coal was first mined commercially in the United States
in 1745 near Richmond, Virginia. In 1760, British soldiers
started mining the Pittsburgh Coal seam on Coal Hill (now
Mt. Washington) across the Monongahela River from Fort
Pitt (Figure 3). By 1800, only Pittsburgh and Richmond,
Virginia were using coal to any extent for domestic purpos
es. In early 1807, a Mr. Cuming, traveling from Philadelphia
to Pittsburgh, upon reaching Greensburg, PA wrote:
On entering Habach s tavern, I was no little surprised to
see a fine coal fire, and I was informed that coal is the princi
pal fuel of the country, fifty or sixty miles round Pittsburgh.
It is laid down at the doors here for six cents a bushel.
(Eavenson, 1939)
In Pittsburgh, 10 collieries (e.g. a coal mine with con
nected coalprocessing structures) were working in Coal
Hill in 1837 (Eavenson, 1939) across the Monongahela
River from the City. By 1865, coke produced from coal was
increasingly important in iron processing (Gregory, 1980).
There are few reports on coal and coke production before
1870 and no accurate records until 1885 (Eavenson, 1942).
Mining Methods
Room and pillar mining originated as a method of ex
tracting as much coal as possible while still providing roof
control by means of coal pillars. During the 18th and 19th
centuries, mines were small handexcavated operations un
der shallow cover using hillside adits to enter the coal seam.
Coal was cheap and the spacing, size, and regularity of pil
lars were somewhat arbitrary (Figure 25). Coal pillars were
left in place as a matter of convenience and safety to the
miners. Increased production by the mid to late19th cen
tury brought mechanization and ventilation requirements to
mines that necessitated a systematic arrangement of pillars,
but still resulted in considerable coal being left underground.
Mining often extended to where the overburden was only 25
feet thick. Early extraction ratios, the proportion of coal re
moved, averaged 30 to 40 percent. Since coal deposits were
widespread and accessible, little effort was made to improve
extraction ratios.

Figure 26. Example of Room and Pillar Mining
(Gray et al., 1974).

Geology of Pittsburgh
In the latter part of the 19th century, total extraction min
ing was initiated to achieve greater production of the coal
that was becoming increasingly valued for its coking prop
erties by the steel industry, and as the preferred feedstock
for manufactured gas plants, was first implemented in exist
ing partial extraction mines of the day. The distinction from
partial extraction mines was the long, narrow pillars left be
tween rooms during first mining were now being extracted in
a second stage of mining. Subsidence of the ground surface
in a properly executed operation took place contemporane
ously with pillar extraction (Gray and Bruhn, 1984).
Wide rooms and narrow pillars (10 to 15 feet wide) con
tinued in total extraction mines because it was believed that
more lump coal could be produced by room mining than
by extracting the pillars left between rooms. However, by
the 1920s, block systems of mining came into favor, (See
Figure 26) wherein square or rectangular pillars 50 to 100
feet on a side were separated by narrow rooms and entries,
reducing roof deterioration, roof falls, and support problems
during pillar extraction (Paul and Plein, 1935). From 1948
to 1952, most remaining mines of the old pattern were con
verted to the block system as continuous mining machines
were introduced on a large scale. Subsequently, as break
lines controlling failure of the mine roof parallel to the pil
lar faces replaced angled break lines, the transition to the
relatively efficient pillar extraction methods of today was
essentially complete (Gray and Bruhn, 1984).
Longwall mining is another total extraction technique.
The advantage is that it is a one stage operation. It was tried in
the United States prior to 1900, but was not found to be eco
nomical here until 1960, after development of selfadvancing
roof supports (Poad, 1977).
Entries for access and ventilation are very similar to
those for room and pillar mining. The extraction face of a
mine panel is equipped with a row of hydraulic roof sup
ports, a coal conveyor, and a machine to break the coal from
the panel face. The system (See Figure 27) is designed to
support only the area at the coal panel face and allow caving
of the mine roof behind the support system, with the roof
support system and conveyor automatically advanced as
mining proceeds. Coal pillars supporting the entries are gen
erally not recoverable (Gray and Bruhn, 1984). In longwall
mining, the width of mined panels can exceed 1200 feet and
the length of the panels can be a mile or more.
Virtually all of the economically minable bituminous coal
resources of Pennsylvania are confined to 10 important coal
beds in the Allegheny, Monongahela and Dunkard Groups.
The Pittsburgh Coal is the most important seam in
Pennsylvania. In 2010, 16 longwalls (41 of the U.S. total)
operated in the Pittsburgh Coal, including seven in Pennsyl
vania and nine in West Virginia (Fiscor, 2011). In spite of
extensive mining, it still represents one third of the recov
erable reserves over 36 inches thick and almost all of the
reserves over 60 inches thick. Most of the remaining Pitts
burgh Coal is in Washington and Greene Counties, south
of Pittsburgh. It is a single, very persistent bed, generally
between 4 and 10 feet thick, and is absent only in relatively
limited areas (McCulloch et al., 1975; Socolow et al., 1980).
The Pittsburgh Coal is of excellent quality overall and has
been widely used for metallurgical grade coke. Except in
northwestern Washington County and eastern Greene Coun
ty, its sulfur content is less than 2 percent (Socolow et al.,
1980). Almost all production of the Pittsburgh Coal, past
and present, is from underground mines.
In the Pittsburgh area, the Upper Freeport Coal is the
second most important bed in terms of mining and reserves.
(See Figure 11).
Pennsylvania bituminous coal (51,877 short tons in
2009) is mined for three markets: electric power generation,
industrial use, and foreign export. The domestic distribution
varies, but in 2009, electric utilities consumed 94 percent,
and industrial use, including coke, 5 percent. Foreign ex
ports were approximately 4500 short tons (U.S. Energy In
formation Administration, 2011).
Aggregates
Major sources of construction aggregates in the Pitts
burgh area are sand and gravel, crushed stone, and repur
posed steel mill slag (ONeil, 1974). The sand and gravel is
primarily glacially derived material, while the crushed stone
is manufactured from local limestones and sandstones and
Figure 27. Longwall Mine (Turka and Gray, 2005).
23
Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
the slag is a manmade byproduct resulting from iron and
steel making.
As noted earlier, multiple periods of continental glaci
ation occurred to the north of Pittsburgh and during at least
two stages of glaciation, the Illinoian and the Wisconsinian,
moved into northwestern Pennsylvania. Much of the materi
al deposited by the glaciers is located in the northern portion
of the state along the borders of the ice advance or behind
them as surficial features (moraines, eskers, kames, etc.).
However, with the melting of the glaciers, larger amounts of
sand and gravel were transported to the south by the melt
water and were deposited in the valleys of the Allegheny,
Ohio and Beaver Rivers and their tributaries. The repetitive
advance and retreat of the ice sheets resulted in multiple
periods of sand and gravel deposition in the river valleys.
During periods of significant deposition, the river valleys
would fill with outwash deposits and aggrade. During the
periods between the depositions, the rivers would down
cut, leaving behind outwash terraces along the banks of the
rivers and in the surrounding upland areas. By the end of
continental glaciation, the outwash deposits had been re
worked numerous times by the glacial meltwaters, which
had cleaned and sorted the sands and gravels and also tend
ed to break down the softer materials, leaving hard, sound
fragments. The end result is that significant deposits of sand
and gravel can be found within the river beds, their flood
plains and within the higher river terraces.
Original bodies of Illinoian age glacial outwash sand
and gravel deposits were estimated to have exceeded 120
feet in places and were generally found to be 90 feet thick or
less. Many of the gravels derived from less resistant rocks
tend to be weathered, owing to the older age of the deposits,
but the sand generally remains hard, being derived primar
ily from quartzrich crystalline source rocks. The younger
Wisconsinian age sands and gravels were estimated to have
been at least 150 feet thick in places but they were generally
found to not be as thick, with measured sections generally
about 70 to 80 feet thick or less. The gravel in these deposits
is relatively unweathered, so the deposits tend to be excel
lent sources of high quality sand and gravel.
Limestone is the primary source for crushed stone ag
gregate in the Pittsburgh region, followed by sandstone,
which in the 1970s accounted for less than 10 percent of
the overall crushed stone market (ONeil, 1974). The most
important sources of limestone in the area are the Loyal
hanna and Vanport limestones. The Loyalhanna limestone is
Mississippian in age and is a massive finegrained siliceous
carbonate composed of quartz grains in a limestone matrix.
The bed varies from 40 to 70 feet thick and is considered
a good quality coarse aggregate. Uses include coarse ag
gregate for concrete, base and subbase roadway material,
roadway surface treatment, riprap and railroad ballast. The
nearby occurrences are in the ridges to the east of Pittsburgh
and the currently operating quarries are 50 miles or more
from Pittsburgh (Barnes, 2011), somewhat limiting the mar
ketability of the stone because of the associated transporta
tion costs.
The Vanport limestone, which is located in the Pennsyl
vanian age Allegheny Group, is generally a massive, dense
fossiliferrous marine limestone. The thickness of the Vanport
is quite variable, generally on the order of 15 feet to 20 feet
thick, and has been found to be absent in some areas. The
greatest measured bed thickness ranges from 40 feet to 45
feet. It is not an exceptionally highgrade stone. It is used as
flux for iron and steel making, for cement and for agricultur
al limestone as well as for coarse aggregate. The Vanport is
not used for highway surface treatment because it polishes
with traffic wear and develops a high skid characteristic (i.e.
it becomes slick). Although there are significant reserves in
the counties to the north of Pittsburgh, the operating quarries
are 35 miles or more (Barnes, 2011) from the city, resulting
in transportation costs that limit its marketability.
Slag piles are concentrated around Pittsburgh primarily
along the rivers adjacent to the historic and existing iron and
steel mills. In the region, there are two types of slag, (1) slag
from open hearth, basic oxygen and electric furnaces used in
steel making and (2) blast furnace slag from the production of
iron. The steel making operations produce one basic type of
slag but the blast furnace slag can be any of three different but
basically chemically identical materials, depending on how the
hot slag was tipped and cooled. (1) Air cooled slag is cooled
naturally, and is crushed and screened to produce a coarse ag
gregate that is used in concrete and road base. (2) Granulated
slag is formed when slag is quickly quenched in water creating
a glassy, sand sized granular product that is used in many appli
cations for which sand is used and for agricultural liming. (3)
Lightweight or expanded slag, a slag created by the controlled
processing of molten slag with water, forms a lightweight ma
terial with a bulk relative density of about 70 percent that of air
cooled slag (FHA, 2012). Open hearth slag is used primarily as
railroad ballast and had been used as a base or subbase mate
rial in highway construction. Open hearth slag and other slag
from steel making furnaces can be expansive when exposed to
water and should not be used in confined areas without labora
tory confirmation testing. More detailed information is provid
ed in the section on expansive slags.
There are other potential but minor aggregate sources in
the area, including other limestones, a number of sandstone
units, sintered flyash and expanded clays and shales.
Iron Ore
Although Allegheny County, which eventually became
the steel capital of the world, did not contain iron ore, sider
ite ores were present in Pennsylvanian age rocks in adjacent
counties.
Most of the siderite ores were nodular or concretionary.
Enriched, secondary limonite deposits commonly developed
from weathering of the carbonate nodules. Siderite ores gen
24
Geology of Pittsburgh
erally ranged from 30 to 40 percent iron, whereas the en
riched limonitic derivatives averaged about 50 percent. In
the early charcoaliron furnaces, the lower grade unaltered
siderite ores were mixed with limonitic ores from the same
mine. The great era of carbonatecharcoal iron production
in Western Pennsylvania lasted from 1825 to 1855. The last
extensive mining of carbonate ore took place in Fayette and
Westmoreland Counties prior to 1900 (Inners, 1999).
As the original hardwood forests were cleared, fuel for
the iron furnaces switched in the 1850s to coal. About 1875,
coal was replaced by coke (White, 1979) from local coal.
Limestone flux was added to the furnaces to bond with mol
ten ironore impurities, creating a glassy slag.
The early Pittsburgh region furnaces produced cast iron
which has a high carbon content (34.5 percent), making
it brittle after casting. This cast iron was either cast direct
ly into goods or into ingots for transport to iron foundries
where the ingots were converted into a more workable form,
wrought iron (Hannibal et al., 2011).
Pennsylvanias first iron furnace began production in
1692 (Hannibal et al., 2011). By the time of the American
Revolution there were nearly 60 iron furnaces in Pennsylva
nia, and by 1841 there were well over 200 (Moldenke, 1920).
Pittsburghs first iron furnace was erected in 1792. In the first
half of the nineteenth century Pittsburgh was not known for
its cast iron production, but for the foundries which convert
ed the cast iron into wrought iron (Moldenke, 1920).
Development of the Superior ore province in the Great
Lakes region eventually put the iron mining industry of
western Pennsylvania out of business. However, the iron and
steel industry in Pittsburgh continued to grow because bitu
minous coal (and its coke) became an important ingredient
in the process by the mid1800s, and Pittsburgh was the hub
of coal production. Eventually, Pittsburgh became the largest
iron and steel producing center in the world (Gardner, 1980).
Water Supply
Water has always been readily available to Pittsburgh
and the surrounding communities from the abundance of
surface water in the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio Riv
ers. Annual mean discharge data, based on nearby longterm
USGS stream gaging stations, show the Allegheny River
(USGS Water Data, Allegheny) at 19,750 cubic feet per
second (cfs), the Monongahela River (USGS Water Data,
Monongahela) at 12,650 cfs, resulting in flow at the head of
the Ohio River (at Pittsburgh) of about 32,400 cfs.
The most plentiful groundwater source is from the gla
cial outwash alluvium that overlies the bedrock of the major
stream valleys (Gallaher, 1973). This alluvial aquifer gener
ally consists of an older, basal portion that overlies bedrock,
and an upper portion that was recently deposited. Ground
water is derived primarily from the basal portion of the al
luvium and the relative groundwater yield from it depends
upon which river system it is located in. The Allegheny
Valley generally has the coarsest basal alluvium, composed
primarily of sand and gravel derived from melting glaciers
to the north, while the Monongahela Valley contains finer
grained silts, sands and clays derived from the erosion of the
local argillaceous rock lying east and south of Pittsburgh.
Alluvium in the Ohio River is a mixture of alluvium from
the two rivers. The permeability can change significantly
over short distances within the alluvium, but for compara
tive purposes; well yields in the Ohio and Allegheny valleys
average about 350 gallons per minute (gpm) while yields
from the Monongahela valley wells average about 125 gpm.
Groundwater is available from the Pennsylvanian age
rocks nearly everywhere in the Pittsburgh area, but the yields
from wells tend to be significantly lower than from the alluvi
al deposits. The well yields from rock wells tend to be highly
variable, with many of the yields being less than five gpm but
some wells reach yields of 75 to 100 gpm (Gallaher, 1973).
The primary aquifers are the harder rocks (sandstones,
limestones) which have minimal primary permeability, but
tend to fracture well, resulting in significant, natural second
ary permeability. Much of the secondary permeability in the
sandstones and limestones is created by stress relief fracturing
(Ferguson, 1967) caused by erosion and unloading of the rock
units along stream valleys, along with tensional and compres
sional fracturing along the axes of the structural folds in the
area. Valley stress release as discovered and described by Fer
guson (1967), and further described by Ferguson and Hamel
(1981). This involves physical stress release changes to the
physical integrity of the flat lying sedimentary rock layers as
a valley is cut through the layers by erosion. As overburden
is removed, stresses contained within the rocks are released.
This generally manifests itself as open, tensionrelated, near
vertical features in valley walls, and compression features tak
ing the form of low angle thrust faults in the valley floors.
Harry Ferguson and his U.S. Army Corps of Engineers col
leagues observed this phenomenon in numerous excavations

into Pittsburgh area river bottoms during construction of the
series of Ohio River navigation locks and dams. Figure 28
illustrates the process of valley stress release.
There are 78 public water supply systems in Allegheny
County that service 99 percent of the almost 1,225,000 coun
ty residents. The systems, including the system for the City
of Pittsburgh, are overseen by the Allegheny County Health
Department. Pittsburgh is serviced by the Pittsburgh Water
and Sewer Authority (PWSA, 2014), which serves 196,000
water and sewer customers within the City.
The first documented public water supply system in Pitts
burgh was constructed in 1802 and consisted of four wells,
serving a population of about 1600 residents. By 1828, the
rapid growth of the City resulted in water shortages that even
tually required construction of a river pumping station along
the Allegheny River. The station supplied 40,000 gallons of
water per day. The systems were expanded and updated as
the population grew and the City expanded, reaching 9 mil
lion gallons per day (mgd) by 1844, and 15 mgd by 1878, to
service a population of 106,000 people. Water treatment was
initiated in 1902, primarily using filtration. The first complete
chemical treatment system of the water was installed in the
1960s, followed by replacement of slow sand filters with a
dual media, rapid sand filter system in 1969 (PWSA, 2014).
Groundwater wells continued to be used in the City but
were not the primary source of drinking water. In 1927, begin
ning with a well for the Stanley Theater, a number of the water
wells in the City were drilled strictly for air conditioning pur
poses (Van Tuyl, 1951). By 1950, the volume of groundwater
utilized for air conditioning had increased to about 500 mil
lion gallons per year, or about 25 percent of the total ground
water usage per year. On a daily rate basis, during the average
airconditioning season (100120 days), the air conditioning
use in 1950 was about 50 percent of the total groundwater
use per day. Utilizing the alluvial aquifer under the City for
air conditioning purposes has continued into the twentyfirst
century, as evidenced by the 2007 installation of a subsurface
geothermal heat pump system into the alluvium underlying
Point State Park (at the confluence of the three rivers) to heat
as well as cool the blockhouse museum of Fort Pitt.
Hydropower
Hydropower has been a part of the Pittsburgh region
for many years. Four of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Geology of Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh District reservoirs currently generate hydropow
er: Kinzua Dam and Reservoir; Youghiogheny Dam and
Reservoir; Conemaugh Dam and Reservoir; and the fourth,
Mahoning Dam, recently started generating hydropower
(Kurka et al., 2014). Kinzua Dam and Reservoir is located
on the Allegheny River near Warren, PA. At this location,
the electric utility First Energy (contemporary survivor of
Associated Gas  Electric Co. [AGECO], 19061946)
draws water both from the Corps of Engineers Allegheny
Reservoir and also from a pumped storage reservoir located
high above the left abutment of the dam. The project is a
peaking plant, which means that it pumps water up to the
storage reservoir at night when electric rates are low, and
then sends the water down an inclined power tunnel to the
power plant during the day when power demand is high.
As mentioned, two other Corps reservoirs also have hy
dropower generation: Youghiogheny Dam, located south
of Pittsburgh, and Conemaugh Dam, located northeast of
Pittsburgh. Mahoning Dam is a concrete gravity structure
also located northeast of Pittsburgh that was originally built
with a penstock, allowing the project to be fitted for future
power generation. The penstock has been retrofitted with a
turbine and downstream power plant to generate hydropow
er. Construction of the power plant at Mahoning Dam has
been completed.
There are five low head hydroelectric plants currently in
place at existing locks and dams (LD) near Pittsburgh. Four
are located on the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh; LD 5
(at Freeport, PA); LD 6 (at Clinton, PA); LD 8 (Temple
ton, PA); and LD 9 (at Rimer, PA). The fifth is at Hannibal
Locks and Dam, located on the Ohio River close to Wheel
ing, West Virginia. The four low head hydroelectric plants
located on the Allegheny River were built in the late 1980s.
Figure 29 provides an aerial view of the plant at Allegheny
Dam 5 (Freeport, PA). At each of these five sites the gen
erating plant is located on the side of the river opposite the
navigation lock. Power generation permits have been filed
for many of the remaining navigation structures and flood
control reservoirs by private electric power developers. Fed
eral tax credits have stimulated developers to file these per
mits; however, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
licensing process is arduous, and therefore, at this time fur
ther hydropower development in the region will occur only
gradually, consistent with the response of the Government.
GEOLOGIC CONSTRAINTS
Seismicity and Earthquake Hazard
Southwest Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh, is a rela
tively inactive seismic area. Earthquake activity in surround
ing areas is somewhat more intense. These areas include the
Piedmont Province in eastern Pennsylvania; northwestern
Ohio; New York State, immediately east of Buffalo, at Atti
ca, New York; and in the St. Lawrence River Valley.
The largest earthquakeofrecord in Pennsylvania, a
magnitude 5.2, (mbLg) occurred on September 25, 1998, in
northwestern Pennsylvania near the Ohio Border (Fleeger
et al., 1999). However, Pennsylvania earthquakes are gen
erally small. Only twice per decade, on average, is an earth
quake epicentered within Pennsylvania that is large enough
(Richter magnitude 3 or greater) to be felt in an area of sev
eral hundred square kilometers (Gordon and Dewey, 1999).
The Pennsylvania Geologic Surveys Map 69, Earthquake
Catalog and Epicenter Map of Pennsylvania, (Faill, 2004)
is the basic reference document showing the location of and
listing all recorded seismic events since 1724 in Pennsyl
vania and surrounding areas. Some of the events that have
been cataloged as earthquakes in the greater Ridge and
Valley or Appalachian Plateaus Provinces were not tectonic
earthquakes but mine explosions or related to mine subsid
ence (Gordon and Dewey, 1999).
About 35 earthquakes have caused slight damage in Penn
sylvania since the beginning of the American Colonial period.
Occasional broken windows, cracked plaster and glassware
toppled from shelves is characteristic of this type of damage.
Nearly one half of these damaging events had outofstate epi
centers. Foremost among this class of distant earthquakes that
were felt strongly in Pennsylvania were a trio of major earth
quakes near New Madrid, MO in 18111812, and the Charles
ton, SC earthquake in 1886. Most earthquakes with epicenters
inside the state have been located in southeastern Pennsylva
nia (Gordon and Dewey, 1999). Schamberger, 2003, provides
general information on the nature, occurrence, history, and
earthquake hazards in Pennsylvania.
Faults
Bedrock faults in the Pittsburgh region exhibit relative
ly small displacements. These include normal faults and
thrust faults. The faults that have been identified to date are
not capable of generating significant earthquakes. An exam
ple of a small offset normal fault near Pittsburgh is depicted

in Figure 30 and a typical low angle thrust fault is shown in
Figure 31. A key process in the development of small faults
of importance to the region is valley stress release, as previ
ously described in the section on water supply.
One of the most structurally complex areas, typical of the
relative importance of faults to the design and construction of
engineered works, located about 16 miles north of the city, is a
faultedrock zone observable along the B  O Railroad tracks
at the Bakerstown Station rock cut. Figure 32 is a representa
tion of the west wall of the cut and depicts high angle faulting
within the Casselman Formation shales and claystones. Fault
ing is present within these fine grainedrocks of lower mass
shear strength, but does not penetrate the overlying Morgan
town Sandstone. This has been interpreted that the faulting
ceased before deposition of the overlying Morgantown Sand
stone (Wagner et al., 1970).
Several normal faults cut the Ames Limestone near
Creighton, PA, located about 15 miles northeast of the city,
creating a massive block of rock that has dropped down be
tween the faults forming a classic graben structure. Reverse
faults are far less common in Allegheny County than are nor
mal faults (Harper, 2012). One of the better examples can be
seen in a road cut along PA Route 28 at Tarentum, PA. At this
location a portion of the lighter colored Mahoning Sandstone
can be seen thrust upwards over and into darker colored shales.
A suspected strikeslip fault, representing the least com
mon of fault orientations around Pittsburgh, is the inferred
displacement of the crystalline basement rocks, at some
16,000 feet beneath Pittsburgh, detected by magnetic geo
physical surveys (Harper, 2012).
In 2010, construction at a sewage treatment plant in Se
wickley Township, 18 miles southeast of downtown Pitts
burgh, revealed an ancient but locally significant fault. At this
location, the Pennsylvanian aged sedimentary strata exhibit
gentle northeastsouthwest trending folds, the dip of the beds
is very slight (12 degrees) and tectonic faults are rare (Hamel,
2011). Available mine maps for the area indicate the plant is
underlain by abandoned room and pillar workings within the
Pittsburgh Coal Member. The floor of the mined seam is at a
depth of approximately 90 feet. Excavation for a raw sewage
pump station exposed a major tectonic fault zone at least 500
feet wide and 20 feet thick with a brecciated zone containing
sandstone blocks up to 15 feet in diameter in a matrix of finer
breccia and fault gouge (Hamel, 2011). The fault was mapped
as having both thrust and transverse components, and appears
to have been related to the brittle response of the gentle fold
ing of interbedded stronger and weaker sedimentary rocks
during the Appalachian Orogeny. (Hamel, 2011) indicates that
faulting of this type should be routinely expected and consid
ered for site investigations related to foundationload sensitive
future engineering projects in the Pittsburgh region.
Landslides
The Appalachian Plateau has long been recognized as an
area of major landslide severity with its steep hillsides, thick
soil cover and precipitation of 3545 inches per year (Figure

gently folded but essentially flatlying sedimentary rocks.
Slope Formation
Current slope development in the unglaciated por
tion of the Appalachian Plateau is consistent with flatly
ing sedimentary rocks in a temperate, humid climate. The
occurrence of alternating weak and resistant rock strata is
reflected topographically by breaks in slope and somewhat
subdued due to welldeveloped erosional benches (Gray et
al., 1979; Gray and Gardner, 1977).
Existing and past climatic conditions, including peri
glacial effects, have resulted in substantial mechanical and
chemical weathering, which produced a residual or collu
vial soil mantle over almost the entire rock surface. The
most significant periglacial effects were the greater rates of
weathering, increased soil formation and subsequent mass
wasting (Denny, 1956; Philbrick, 1961; Rapp, 1967).
Downslope movement of the soil results in its accumu
lation at the toes of slopes in colluvial masses. These collu
vial soils tend to be 5  30 feet thick on slopes and generally
increase in thickness (to a maximum of about 100 feet) near
the toes of slopes unless there is active stream erosion (See
Figure 34). Colluvial soils are generally stiff to hard, and
individual samples have relatively high shear strengths.
However, creep or sliding processes (or both) during slope
development generally reduce the shear strength along
movement surfaces to residual or nearresidual levels (Gray
et al., 1979). These low strength shear surfaces can occur
at several levels within the colluvial mass but there is al
ways a low strength shear surface at the soilrock interface
(Deere and Patton, 1971). As the slope materials seek equi
librium between stress and strength, the soil mantle moves
downslope and the mean slope angle decreases, until a state
of marginal equilibrium is achieved. This natural slopeflat
tening process accounts for the relatively thick soil cover on
mature colluvial slopes, particularly at the base of slopes.
Deere and Patton (1971) have suggested that there are no
stable natural slopes in the Appalachian Plateau where the
slope inclination exceeds 1214. Terzaghi and Peck (1948),
report movements on slopes as flat as 10, whereas Gray
and Donovan (1971) demonstrated that several mature col
luvial slopes, with evidence of preexisting failure surfaces,
had slope angles ranging from 7 to 10. Gray and Gardner
(1977) presented observations on the development of collu
vial slopes.
Numerous field observations suggest that colluvial
slopes, which may creep at rates of a few centimeters per
year, visually appear stable unless disturbed by cutting,
filling, drainage changes, or extreme precipitation events
(Gray et al., 2011).
Landsliding
As stated above, the Appalachian Plateau is recognized
as having some of the most severe landsliding in the United
States (Ladd, 19271928; Sharpe and Dosch, 1942; Acken
heil, 1954; Eckel, 1958; Baker and Chieruzzi, 1959). Most
landslides in the Appalachian Plateau occur in hillside soil
masses, with the most common being slumptype slides or
slow earth flows which range in size up to several million
cubic yards. Rockfalls, the next most common type of slide
in the area, are typically much smaller with maximum vol
umes on the order of a few hundred cubic yards. The best
documented rockslide occurred at the Brilliant Cut in Pitts
burgh in 1941 (Hamel, 1972), (See landslide case histories
in the following section). At present, deepseated rockslides
are uncommon in the area. However, during the Pleistocene
Epoch, when climate was more severe and rivers were rapidly
downcutting their valleys, this type of slide is believed to have
been common. Other types of slide movements are relatively
rare. Injuries and fatalities due to landslides are rare and result
mainly from rockfalls on highway slopes and soil falls in con
struction trench excavations.
Residual strength values play an important role in the
evaluation of landslides and the design of remedial measures
in the area. The colluvium generally exhibits strainsoftening
behavior (Skempton, 1964) and its residual (large displace
ment) shear strength is generally less than half its peak (small
displacement) strength at a given effective normal stress. For
effective normal stresses of less than about 50 psi, the peak
strength of claystone colluvium is commonly characterized
by cohesion intercepts of one to five psi and friction angles
of 2025, while the residual strength is usually characterized
by negligible cohesion intercepts and friction angles of 820.
Measured residual friction angles for most claystonederived
colluvium are on the order of 1116 (Gray et al., 1979). Ex
perience in calculation of strength data from colluvial slide
masses (Hamel, 1969; Hamel and Flint, 1969; Hamel and Flint
1972; Gray and Donovan, 1971; Hamel, 1980, 2004) indicates
Figure 34. Thick Colluvial Soil Cover
Colluvial masses develop having volumes of several million
cubic meters and thickness of up to 30 m. Mature colluvial
slopes may exhibit angles as flat as 7  10. Many large
colluvial masses interfinger with glacial outwash, and
radiocarbon dating indicates they may have formed under
periglacial conditions.
29
Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
that inplace shear strengths are characterized by residual level
friction angles of 1316, with a zero cohesion intercept.
The largest slides usually result from disturbance of an
cient landslide masses in soils andor rock. These ancient
landslides appear to have mainly occurred in a moister peri
glacial conditions (Gray et al., 1979; Hamel 1998). Limit
ed radiocarbon dating of wood in the colluvium (Philbrick,
1961; DAppolonia et al., 1967) suggest a Pleistocene age
for some of these deposits. Peltier (1950) and Denny (1956)
found fossil periglacial features close to the front of the
maximum advance of the Wisconsinian glaciation in Penn
sylvania which strongly support the influence of Pleistocene
periglacial processes on slopes.
Rockfalls result from differential weathering, creating
unsupported, resistant rock overhangs. Rates of undercut
ting have been observed that vary from one inch to seven
inches per year, based on measurements conducted over a
period of several years (Philbrick, 1959; Bonk, 1964).
Fleming and Taylor (1980) published landslide damage
estimates for Allegheny County (Pittsburgh and suburbs)
from 1970 to 1976. Annual costs ranged from 1.2 to 4.0
million over this 7year period and averaged 2.2 million
per year. The maximum annual cost of 4 million was for
1972, the year of tropical storm Agnes.
Landslide Case Histories
Brilliant Cut Rock Slide
Several rockfalls and landslides in the Pittsburgh, area
have been costly in lives and money. An historic case in
volves the failure of 110,000 cubic yards of rock that broke
away from a large railroad cut in Pittsburgh on March 20,
1941 (Hamel, 1972). The area of the catastrophic rock slide
is known as the Brilliant Cut. The rock cut was located on
the nose of a hill at the junction of an abandoned tributary
valley and the Allegheny River valley. The hill consists of
nearly horizontal beds of sandstone, shale, siltstone, clay
stone and coal. The cut was originally excavated in the
early 1900s, and in 1904 experienced its first rock slide.
In 1930, the railroad tracks were relocated farther into the
rock slope, triggering two additional slope failures (Xan
thakos et al., 1994). In addition, in the 1930s a onefoot
wide joint opened in the rock mass which extended to the
crest of the hill. The joint was persistent extending through
the rock layers and has been interpreted to be a valleystress
relief joint (Hamel, 1972).
The March, 1941 rock slide displaced multiple sets of
railroad tracks and derailed an operating train. The reme
dial rock excavation cost was about 100,000. Analyses
conducted subsequent to the slope failure indicated that the
rock slide was triggered by cleft (joint) water pressure that
had built up within the master rock joint, primarily because
natural drainage from within the slope had been blocked by
large buildups of ice.
Aliquippa Rock Slide
On December 22, 1942, about 150 cubic yards of rock
plunged off a highway cut on the west bank of the Ohio
River about 16 miles downstream of Pittsburgh, killing
many factory workers riding in a bus. (Gray et al., 1979)
On that day, at 5:03 p.m., an Ohio Valley Motor Coach bus
left from Aliquippa (the site of an operating steel plant) for
Pittsburgh. The bus was filled with wartime steel workers
on their way home following completion of a work shift.
At 5:12 p.m., the time that victims watches stopped, the
bus was demolished by an avalanche of rock, loosened by
freezing and thawing, falling 75 feet down the hillside and
crushing the bus. Two of the largest blocks were estimated
to be in the range of 100 tons each. The accident killed 22
passengers and injured three.
The valley wall at the location of the rock slide was
approximately 360 feet high with a mean inclination of 30
to 35 degrees (Gray et al., 1979). Adjustments to the slope
were made in 1922, with the excavation of a 45 foot side
hill cut. At the road level, approximately 15 feet of erod
ible clay shale was exposed and overlain by 6 feet of soft
claystone. These weak rock layers were overlain by about
18 feet of hard sandy shale with numerous joints oriented
parallel to the valley wall. The clayshale and claystone units
rapidly weathered, undercutting the hard sandy shale above.
Records supplied by Ackenheil (1954) indicate that at least
nine major rock falls occurred on this section of road be
tween 1932 and 1954. This event remains the worst rock
slide to occur in the Pittsburgh region. This slope was later
redesigned to minimize rockfalls and reconstruction of the
slope was completed in 1956.
Expansive Shales and Slags
Expansive Shales
Structural damage due to heaving caused by expansive
sulfide minerals in shales was first recorded in western Penn
sylvania in 1950 (Dougherty and Barsotti, 1972). Heaving
of the ground results from oxidation of sulfide minerals such
as pyrite and marcasite. Finely divided, black, amorphous
sulfide minerals are very susceptible to oxidation due to
their relatively large surface area.
Iron sulfide content of the expansive shales usually ex
ceeds one percent by weight. However, damaging heave is
reported for sulfide contents as low as 0.1 percent. Many
of the expansive shales, although not all, are dark in col
or. These dark shales are often called carbonaceous shale,
which implies the shales dark color is due to high carbon
content. Often the dark color is due to black amorphous sul
fide minerals rather than carbon.
Researchers report weathering of the shale is partly bio
chemical, and caused by autotrophic bacteria belonging to
the ThiobacillusFerrobacillus group. The preferred envi
30
Geology of Pittsburgh
ronment for this expansion process seems to be warm, rel
atively dry and with a plentiful supply of air (Penner et al.,
1973). No clear relationship has been identified between the
amount of heaving and iron sulfide content or thickness of
the shale (Dougherty and Barsotti, 1972). When identified
in the planning stage of a project, the state of practice is
to avoid the expansive horizons by setting building levels
below or well above the potentially expansive materials, or
to remove them by excavation. If this cannot be done, the
expansive shales are sealed with concrete or bitumastic ma
terials in an attempt to prevent oxidation. However, there
remains some risk of heave.
Although no correlations have been identified that relate
maximum heave to thickness of the expansive shale or per
cent of sulfide content (Dougherty and Barsotti, 1972), heave
is a process that can continue for many years. Heave can
be substantial as the oxidized iron sulfides occupy ten times
more space than unoxidized material and the splitting of
the shale causes it to occupy a greater volume (ENR, 1960).
The ENR article indicates structures in Cleveland were still
heaving 25 to 40 years after their construction. In Cleveland,
three story walls and stairways have been cracked, some ap
preciably. In one case a lightly loaded column was raised
4 inches by the heave of the expansive shale (ENR, 1960).
Spanovich and Fewell (1969) report their observations veri
fy heave pressures exceeding 6,000 pounds per square foot.
Queen of Angels (originally named St. Agnes) School
in North Huntingdon, PA (east of Pittsburgh) was built in
1961 as a one story, slab on grade building with the walls
supported on grade beams which spanned between spread
footing foundations. The walls and floors began to crack
shortly after the school opened. The building continued to
heave, and engineering studies in 1989, 1992, 1994 and
1997 found the damage becoming progressively worse. In
1999, it was concluded the schools main structural support
system had failed and that repairs estimated at more than
2.5 million were required. The 39 year old building was
closed and it was demolished in 2000 (Reeger, 2003).
Expansive Slags
Expansion of slags occurs when free calcium and mag
nesium oxides (CaO and MgO) take on water. Particle size is
an important factor controlling the rate of expansion since the
smaller the size the greater the surface area, and the greater the
exposure to moisture. The number of damage cases due to ex
pansive slags is relatively few because producers of potential
ly expansive slag have learned not to use it in their own plants
and generally have placed such slag in waste dumps. The iron
and steel industry produces a variety of slags as byproducts
of its operations. Iron blast furnace slag, both air cooled and
granulated, has a long history of use. However, steel slags
from open hearth, basic oxygen, and electric furnaces have
exhibited expansive properties. (Crawford and Burn, 1969)
Flooding
Pittsburgh has experienced a wide range of flood hazards
including hurricane related rainfall events, spring snow melt,
and releases related to ice jam flooding. Due to its location
at the headwaters of the Ohio River, the region is historically
susceptible to flooding. In the headwaters region of the Ohio
Basin, slopes are often steep and runoff into tributaries and
rivers occurs rapidly. As in other intensivelyurbanized areas
with moderately high precipitation, ground removed from
potential infiltration, such as ground covered by the built en
vironment, (streets and parking lots), the transfer from rain
fall to flood management is nearly instant, and stream surges
can mount within 24 hours, as noted below.
The headwaters region of the Ohio River receives one of
the highest annual rainfall amounts in the country and also
has one of the lowest evaporation rates (Loehlein, 2010).
The region also has one of the highest reliabilities of re
ceiving its annual rainfall in the world. Unlike most regions,
the area surrounding Pittsburgh historically has had flooding
from every direction; for example: from storms that cross
over the Great Lakes to the northwest, thunderstorm activity
originating in the Gulf of Mexico, and hurricanes that form
in the Atlantic Ocean. Average winter snow accumulations
of 4060 inches per year contributes to the areas flood prone
nature. Because of the areas significant relief, flooding of
Pittsburgh can occur within 24 hours after the initiation of
a storm event.
Flooding in Pittsburgh has occurred since the early set
tlement of the region. One of the earliest recorded floods was
at Fort Pitt in January 1762. Many homes were filled with
water and the village surrounding the fort was mud covered.
However, no one drowned from what was then reported as
ye Deluge or Inundation. (Johnson, 1978).
Many devastating floods impacted Pittsburgh. On April
6 and April 19, 1852, floodwaters reached 28 feet and 34.9
feet, respectively, on the Pittsburgh river gage. Normal river
stage at Pittsburgh is 16 feet  and flood stage at the Point
has been established as being any level above 24 feet. On
the Allegheny River just above Pittsburgh, many residents
were routinely prepared to take to standby rafts for protec
tion from the rising waters. The St. Valentines Day Flood
of 1884 peaked in the city at a stage of 36.3 feet, leaving at
least 10,000 Pittsburghers homeless and some 15,000 out of
work (Johnson, 1978). Further down the Ohio River, condi
tions were even more serious, where private and municipal
levees were overtopped.
Devastating flooding again plagued Pittsburgh in 1908,
leading to the formation of a Pittsburgh Flood Commission
to evaluate flooding in the city. It was the first of its kind and
the voluminous Commission report, which was released in
1912, predicted that Pittsburgh would someday experience a
40foot flood stage and recommended construction of a sys
tem of reservoirs and levees to protect the City (Johnson,
1978). A number of surveys were undertaken to determine
31
Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
the optimal sites for dams that would impound reservoirs and
act to attenuate flooding downstream. Some of the major riv
er systems evaluated for such projects were the Allegheny,
Mahoning, and Shenango rivers. Following a flood in 1913,
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took a more aggressive
approach to flooding problems. This was likely a direct reac
tion to the strong opinions of then President Theodore Roos
evelt, who was quoted as saying, while the flood of 1913 was
still receding: We are spending millions for relief of flood
victims, but not one cent to solve flood problems. Roosevelt
declared that it was imperative for the Federal Government
to build multipurpose dams and reservoirs to conserve flood
waters to later use for irrigation, hydroelectric power genera
tion, and improving dry season flows (Johnson, 1978). In di
rect response to this national attention, the Ohio River Flood
Board was formed to initiate Americas first regional flood
mitigation planning. Additional floods impacted Pittsburgh,
with the most significant one occurring in March 1936. That
flood peaked at over thirty feet above normal river level
(46.4 feet actual water depth). This event was then calculated
to represent a record setting 500year flood, and considered
to be the worst flood to impact the Pittsburgh region and the
city (See Figure 35). Subsequently, flood control was initi
ated by the Corps of Engineers in 1938. The severity of the
flooding in Pittsburgh was greatly reduced during the more
recent floods that occurred in 1972, associated with Hurri
cane Agnes, and in 1996, by the system of upstream flood
control reservoirs.
The Great Flood of 1889
On May 31, 1889, approximately 60 miles east of Pitts
burgh, a manmade disaster of unrivaled proportions took
place in the City of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. It was the
Johnstown Flood (or the Great Flood of 1889 as it became
known locally). Heavy rains poured down over this direct
upper subbasin of the Ohio River for several days (Law,
1997). The area surrounding Johnstown remains naturally
prone to flooding due to its position at the confluence of the
Little Conemaugh River and Stony Creek, which form the
Conemaugh River. The area above Johnstown consists of a
657 squaremile watershed within the Allegheny Plateau.
Adding to these factors, artificial narrowing of the riverbed
because of early industrial development made the city even
more floodprone. The Conemaugh River immediately down
stream of Johnstown is hemmed in by steep mountain slopes.
Upstream of Johnstown, near the small town of South
Fork, the South Fork Dam was originally built between 1838
and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of
a canal water delivery system to be used as a source of water
for a canal basin in Johnstown (McCullough, 1968). With
railroads superseding canal barge transport, the obsolete
South Fork Lake was sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and
later sold again to private interests. A group of notable Pitts
burgh businessmen, including coal and coke magnate Henry
Clay Frick, and Andrew Carnegie led a group to purchase
the reservoir, modify it, and convert it into a private resort
lake for wealthy industrialists of Pittsburgh. They built cot
tages and a clubhouse to create the South Fork Fishing and
Hunting Club, an exclusive mountain retreat. Membership
grew to include over 50 wealthy Pittsburgh steel, coal, and
railroad industrialists. Changes to the lake, which was re
named Lake Conemaugh, included lowering the dam, which
impounded the lake to make its top wide enough to hold a
road, and putting a fish screen in the spillway, which unfor
tunately could also trap debris. These alterations increased
the vulnerability of the dam to overtopping.
Lake Conemaugh sat at 450 feet in elevation above
Johnstown. The lake was about 2 miles long, approximately
1 mile wide, and 60 feet deep near the dam. The lake had
a perimeter of 7 miles and held 20 million tons of water.
When the water was at its highest point in the spring, the
lake covered over 400 acres. The dam was 72 feet high and
931 feet long. Between 1881, when the club was opened, and
1889, the dam frequently leaked and was patched, mostly
with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner removed
and sold for scrap the three cast iron discharge pipes that
previously allowed a controlled release of water, as a form
of safetyrelated control of the impounded water level. There
had been some speculation as to the dams integrity, raised
by the head of the Cambria Iron Works, which was located
directly downstream, in Johnstown. Carnegie Steels chief
competitor, the Cambria Iron Works, at that time boasted the

Point (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers).

Geology of Pittsburgh
worlds largest annual steel production. Despite these con
cerns, no major corrective action was taken, and the flawed
dam continued to impound Lake Conemaugh as depicted in
Figure 36 (McCullough, 1968).
In late May 1889, a major storm formed over the Mid
west, moving east. When the storm struck the Johnstown
South Fork area two days later, it was the largest recorded rain
event in that part of the country (Law, 1997). The U.S. Army
Signal Corps estimated that 6 to 10 inches of rain fell with
in 24 hours over the entire region of westcentral Pennsylva
nia. During the night small creeks became roaring torrents,
ripping out trees and carrying significant amounts of debris.
Most telegraph lines were struck down and rail lines washed
away. Before long the Conemaugh River overflowed its
banks. At around 3:10 p.m. on May 31, 1889, the South Fork
Dam failed, allowing the 20 million tons of Lake Conemaugh
to cascade down the narrowly channeled Little Conemaugh
River. It took about 40 minutes for the entire lake to drain. As
the flood wave made its way to Johnstown, it picked up and
carried an immense amount of debris, and there was total dev
astation in the city (See Figure 37). In some areas of the Little
Conemaugh River, the narrowly constrained river transferred
the flood at high velocity, and its own valley bottom was erod
ed down to bedrock. The death and destruction in Johnstown
was nothing less than a total catastrophe. The total death toll
was 2,209, making the disaster the largest loss of civilian life
in the United States at the time, and the worst dam failure in
United States history when measured in terms of loss of life.
The remnants of the failed dam can be seen in place today

as depicted in Figure 38. Following the tragic failure of the
South Fork Dam in 1889, and the subsequent failure of Aus
tin Dam in northcentral Pennsylvania in 1911 (Greene and
Christ, 1998), Pennsylvania instituted one of the first State
dam safety commissions in the nation in 1913.
Coal Mine Subsidence
Historical Background
Mining in western Pennsylvania was concentrated
in the Pittsburgh Coal seam which was accessed by adits
driven into hillsides. From Coal Hill, mining progressed up
the Monongahela River valley and over time moved inland
away from the river  which was still extensively used for
transportation of coal to markets. The land surface above
the mines was largely used for pasture or agriculture. In the
late 1940s and the 1950s, rapidly expanding suburbs were
constructed over both abandoned and active mines. Over the
abandoned mines, most problems were related to sinkhole
formation in areas of shallow mining.
In abandoned mine areas, concerns for subsidence
damage due to pillar failure were mainly limited to schools
and large commercial developments. Most active mines, by
this time, were using full extraction room and pillar min
ing. The mining companies had purchased the coal many
years before, generally with a waiver of surface damage
or the right to legally subside the land surface. However,
many coalmining companies, recognizing social problems,
offered protection to surface landowners. Starting in 1957,
one company even guaranteed safety from subsidence if ap
proximately 50 perecnt of the coal was purchased by home
owners and left in place by the mining company. The extent
of support for a home was usually determined by providing
a zone 15 feet in width around the periphery of the home.
This area was then projected downward and outward at an
angle of 15
o from the vertical to the level of the mine. This
projected area became the recommended area of support.
Unmined pillars of coal equivalent in area to 50 perecnt of
the support area were left in place to prevent subsidence as
indicated in Figure 39. For an average coalseam thickness
of 6 feet, which is typical of the Pittsburgh Coal, approxi
mately 10,000 tons of coal per acre is present. To purchase
support for a single dwelling located a significant distance
above a mine was often a prohibitive cost to homeowners.
For groups of homes where the support areas overlap, the
shared cost was greatly reduced. In 10 years, one compa
ny, which guaranteed surface protection, provided support
for 635 homes and had to make repairs on approximately
2 perecnt of the homes (Gray and Meyers, 1970).
The Bituminous Mine Subsidence and Land Conserva
tion Act of 1966 was enacted by the Commonwealth of Penn
sylvania to prevent undermining which would damage any
public buildings or any noncommercial structures customar
ily used by the public, such as churches, schools, hospitals
and municipal utilities or municipal public services opera
tions, homes and cemeteries. This law covered only struc
tures existing at the time of enactment. For new structures,
the mining law required that subsequent propertyownership

35
Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
deeds, indicate the existence or lack of existence of subsur
face support. Prior to mining, the coal company was required
to contact property owners and assign a price for leaving
coal pillar support as previously described. If the price was
not agreeable to the property owner, then the Secretary of the
State Department of Mines and Mineral Industries assigned
a mediator to determine just compensation for the coal to be
left in place for surface support (Gray and Meyers, 1970).
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977
imposed land use controls on active mines. This law requires
an evaluation of whether subsidence can occur and cause
material damage or diminution of use of structures or renew
able resource lands. If a potential for damage is present, a
plan to prevent or mitigate the damage is required.
Coal Extraction and Subsidence
Subsidence does not occur until mining removes a sig
nificant amount of coal. What is significant is related to the
geometry of the mine, its depth and the physical characteris
tics of the coal and overlying rock strata. In many ways, all
interests are met if complete extraction occurs in a large part
of the mine, which results in subsidence of the ground sur
face contemporaneously with mining. Many mines in oper
ation today utilize longwall mining, which removes all coal
from large areas, or total extraction room and pillar mining,
which systematically removes the coal pillars from one end
of a large panel to the other. Total extraction in room and pil
lar mines has been practiced in the Pittsburgh region since
the latter part of the 19th century.
Subsidence contemporaneous with longwall or total ex
traction room and pillar mining is similar and ceases in a few
months to a few years after mining. However, other mines
only remove a portion of the coal leaving pillars of coal in
place. Uniformly spaced pillars, if of sufficient size relative
to the strength of the mine roof, floor and coal itself, can sup
port the overlying rock strata without subsidence. If the coal
pillars are too weak, subsidence will eventually occur. This
is the case with many old mines. Subsidence over abandoned
mines may continue for many years and is often sporadic.
The availability and quality of mine maps varies
throughout the United States. In the Pittsburgh region mine
maps are usually available for all but the earliest or very
small mines. Large mining companies became common af
ter the Civil War resulting in excellent maps. Gray et al.,
(1996) discuss mine map accuracy.
Mining Related Ground Movements
The angleofdraw defines the limits of subsidence over
a particular minedout area. However, small movements out
side the angle of draw and associated with longwall mining
were recognized about 20 years ago in Australia (Hebble
white, 2001). Although the mechanism of these movements
remains uncertain, possible explanations include one, or a
combination of factors, such as postmining stress relax
ation, valley bulging, regional joint patterns, shearing of
valley walls and beddingplane shear failure (Hebblewhite,
2001). These movements, sometimes described as farfield
movements, may occur over a mile from the longwall panel,
and, thus, well outside the angle of draw (Waddington and
Associates, 2002; Hebblewhite, 2001).
Similar movements have been recently recognized in
southwestern Pennsylvania in studies of longwall mining
Figure 40. Modes of Mine Subsidence (Gray, 1999).
36
Geology of Pittsburgh
under Interstate 70 (GeoTDR, Inc. 2001) and in the remedi
al investigation of leakage of Ryerson Dam in 2005 (Heb
blewhite and Gray, 2014). In monitoring the mining under
Interstate 70, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) cables, in
stalled in deep boreholes, recorded deformations over 1000
feet in front of the advancing mine panel, well beyond the
limits of theoretically anticipated movement around the ac
tive mine panel (GeoTDR, Inc. 2001). Mining of a longwall
panel 2500 feet south of Ryerson Dam is the only apparent
concurrent cause of beddingplane slip in rock beneath the
dam, which was recorded by slope inclinometers (Hebble
white and Gray, 2014a).
Subsidence Modes
Topographic ground surface subsidence features over
mines are classified as sinkholes or troughs (Figure 40). A
sinkhole is a depression in the ground surface that occurs
from collapse of the overburden into a mine opening (a
room or an entry). A trough is a shallow, commonly broad,
dishshaped depression that develops when the overburden
sags downward into a mine opening in response to coal ex
traction, crushing of mine pillars, or punching of pillars into
the mine floor. Troughs develop over both active and aban
doned mines. There appears to be no safe depth of mining
that prevents trough development.
Sinkholes generally develop where the cover above a
mine is relatively thin (Figure 41). Competent strata above
the coal limit sinkhole development (Figure 40). Piggott and
Eynon (1978) indicated that sinkhole development normally
occurs where the interval to the ground surface is less than
three to five times the thickness of the extracted seam, and
that the maximum overburden interval is up to 10 times the
thickness of the extracted seam. In western Pennsylvania,
most sinkholes develop where the soil and rock above a
mine are less than 50 feet thick (Bruhn et al., 1978). A study
of subsidence in the Pittsburgh area revealed that the major
ity of sinkholes, which constituted about 95 percent of all
reported subsidence incidents, occurred on sites located less
than 60 feet above mine level (Bruhn et al., 1981).
Abandoned Mines
Figures 42 and 43 show subsidence damage over aban
doned mines. It appears that:
(1)  Unless total extraction has occurred, there is no in
terval above an abandoned mine that is safe from
subsidence, nor is there necessarily a reduction in
severity of damage with increased intervals;
(2)  Subsidence occurs at reduced frequency with in
creasing overburden thickness; and,
(3)  Unless total extraction has been achieved, subsid
ence may occur long after mining and may not be
limited to a single episode (Gray, 1988).
Item (3) implies that the possibility of future subsid
ence at a site cannot be ruled out merely because subsidence
has not occurred in the first 50 to 100 years after mining.
If abandoned mine openings beneath a site have not been
designed for longterm stability, the potential for subsidence
remains until the openings collapse, or until they are sta
bilized by backfilling, grout columns, or some other engi
neered remedial groundsupport means (Gray et al., 1974).

Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
Precisely when collapse might take place in the absence of
stabilization is not predictable. Even after subsidence has
taken place at a particular site, the possibility of future addi
tional subsidence may remain. Multiple episodes of subsid
ence have been documented at many sites in the Pittsburgh
region (Gray et al., 1977). Pillar failure can fall into three
general categories: delayed, progressive, or sporadic (Abel
and Lee, 1980). Site surveillance programs of a few months
duration or, in fact, indefinite duration cannot provide defin
itive evidence that a site overlying a mine with open voids
will not experience future subsidence (Bruhn et al., 1981).
Insurance programs to provide assistance, if and when
subsidence occurs, appear desirable (DuMontelle et al.,
1981). Pennsylvania and other states have minesubsidence
insurance programs. Such an approach appears more desir
able than largescale urban stabilization programs for resi
dential areas (Gray, 1983).
Volcanism
The Pittsburgh region contains no volcanoes or volcanic
deposits. The closest volcano to Pittsburgh, Mount Trem
blant, is almost 500 miles north in Quebec Province. Howev
er in 1766 Reverend Charles Beatty, a welleducated English
Presbyterian minister, visited Pittsburgh and climbed Coal
Hill where British Soldiers were mining the Pittsburgh Coal.
Reverend Beatty wrote in his journal: In the afternoon we
cross the Mocconghehela River accompanied by two gentle
men, and went up the hill opposite the fort, but a very difficult
ascent, in order to take a view of that part of it more partic
ularly from which the garrison is supplied with coals, which
is not far from the top. A fire being made by the workmen not
far from the place where they dug the coal, and left burning
when they went away, by the small dust communicated itself
to the body of the coals and set it on fire, and has now been
burning almost a twelve month entirely underground, for the
space of twenty yards or more along the face of the hill or
rock, the way the vein of coal extends, the smoke ascending
up through the chinks of the rocks. The earth in some places
is so warm that we could hardly bear to stand upon it: at
one place where the smoke came up we opened a hole in the
earth till it was so hot as to burn paper thrown into it; the
steam that came out was so strong of sulphur that we could
scare bear it. We found pieces of matter there, some of which
appeared to be sulphur, other nitre, and some a mixture of
both. If these strata be large in this mountain it may become
a volcano. The smoke arising out of this mountain appears
to be much greater in rainy weather than at other times. The
fire has already undermined some part of the mountain so
that great fragments of it, and trees with their roots are fallen
down its face. On the top of the Mountain is a very rich soil
covered with fine verdure, and has a very easy slope on the
other side, so that it may be easily cultivated
(Eavenson, 1942).
Although, today such a ridiculous idea is amusing, at
that time it was the accepted wisdom in Europe. Abraham
Werner, the most renowned geologist in Europe, believed
coal was the fuel of volcanoes into the 1800s (Adams, 1938).
Acid Rock
Acid rock drainage is the waterquality hazard resulting
from the oxidation of iron sulfide minerals (Nordstrom and
Alpers, 1999). In the Pittsburgh area and elsewhere in the coal
bearing Pennsylvanian age rocks, it is common to encounter
acid mine drainage generated by coal and pyritic shale.
However, acid rock drainage resulting from oth
er sources was virtually unknown in the area until 2003.
At that time, an excavation for Interstate 99 (I99) at the
Skytop site on Bald Eagle Mountain, located to the west
of State College in Centre County, Pennsylvania, exposed
pyriterich rocks associated with a zinclead deposit within
a sandstone ridge. As part of the I99 work, this sandstone
was excavated, crushed and used locally as road base and
fill. Within months, acidic (pH3), metalladen seeps and
surface runoff was generated from the crushed rock fill and
the exposed pyritic deposits in the roadcut. This raised con
cerns about surface water and groundwater contamination
and prompted a halt in road construction and the beginning
of a costly program of environmental remediation. The Sky
top site posed a reclamation challenge because the road base
and fills were deposited over a large area, there was a lack of
neutralizing minerals in the host rock, and the acidic drain
age exhibited low pH and a complex chemistry. The situa
tion at Skytop was more extreme than situations involving
acid mine drainage from coal mines and is comparable to
environmental problems that develop at abandoned metal
mines. (Hammarstrom et al., 2005).
Pennsylvania had developed special handling tech
niques for coal surface mines spoil and for acid producing
materials in highway construction prior to the Skytop inci
dent. However, pyrite rich sandstones such as those encoun
tered at Skytop had not been identified prior to the highway
excavation and therefore no plans were prepared for han
dling the acid rock. The potential for situations similar to
what had happened at Skytop, where unexpected acid rock
might be encountered, prompted the Pennsylvania Geo
logical Survey to prepare a publication on acid rock in the
Commonwealth. The resultant open file publication (Penn
sylvania Geological Survey, 2005) includes a map showing
the formations that may contain acidforming minerals (pri
marily pyrite). The publication also includes text describing
each of the formations. In the Pittsburgh area, the identified
areas correspond with the coal bearing formations.

TRANSPORTATION
Canals
Philadelphia had been the leading seaport on the Atlan
tic Coast in the 1700s, but in the early 1800s, completion of
the Erie Canal to the north, connecting New York City to the
Great Lakes via the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers, and Mary
lands National Road to the south, connecting Baltimore to
the Ohio River at Wheeling, West Virginia (Shank, 1981) re
sulted in the growth of those two seaports as the emergent
gateways to the great American West. People and goods
transported through Pennsylvania from the east coast to Pitts
burgh were moved primarily by coaches and wagons via a
system of locally owned and constructed turnpikes. Move
ment of people and freight by this pioneer system was slow
and of limited capacity, resulting in high transportation costs.
Conestoga wagons were used to carry freight over the roads
and took about 23 days to go from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.
Pennsylvania constructed a system of canals in order
to improve the transportation from Philadelphia and the
east coast to Pittsburgh and to compete with New York City
and Baltimore. The trunk section of the Pennsylvania Canal
system, referred to as the Main Line of Public Works, ran
from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and covered a distance of
395 miles. Construction began in 1826 and the final link, the
Allegheny Portage Railroad, was completed in 1834. The
Allegheny Portage Railroad was constructed to transport ca
nal boats over the Allegheny Mountains on railroad cars on
a series of inclined planes where the cars were either pulled
up or let down the inclined planes originally with stationary
engines and later with steam locomotives.
The canal boats moved at an average of about four
miles an hour. The canals were generally forty feet wide and
four feet deep, with locks to change elevation. There were
towpaths on either side of the canals for the animals pulling
the canal boats. The canal boats could carry the same loads
as the Conestoga Wagons and shortened the trip from Phil
adelphia to Pittsburgh to about four and onehalf days and
later, to three and onehalf days when steam locomotives
replaced animals on the canal tow paths. The boats varied
in size, with the largest being 79 feet long and capable of
carrying 25 passengers and 30 tons of freight (Shank, 1981).
The canal approached Pittsburgh along the north side of
the Allegheny River and then split, one branch extended to
the north shore of the Allegheny River for access to the Ohio
River and the other branch passed over the Allegheny River
and into Pittsburgh via an aqueduct that was 1,100 feet long
(See Figure 44).
From the aqueduct the canal passed to the main termi
nal and turning basin. The canal was continued to the south,
through a tunnel completed in 1828, and ended on the south
side of the city at a lock structure providing access to the
Monongahela River. Originally, the plan had been to extend
the Chesapeake and Ohio (CO) Canal to Pittsburgh and
connect the two canal systems at the lock structure but the
CO canal was never extended that far.
The original aqueduct over the Allegheny River was
replaced in 1844 by John A. Roeblings first wire cable sus
Figure 44. Pittsburgh 1828 Map Showing Canal (Darby, 1980).

pension bridge, the Allegheny Aqueduct (ExplorePAHis
tory, Roeblings, 2014). Mr. Roebling lived at that time in
Saxonburg, Pa, about an hour north of Pittsburgh, where he
was attempting to establish a settlement of German immi
grants. In 1841, he also obtained a contract to replace the
hemp ropes used to pull the boats on the Portage Railroad
with wire rope and he built a factory at Saxonburg to make
the needed cable. Aside from the Allegheny Aqueduct,
he also designed two other suspension bridges in the city,
the Smithfield Street Bridge over the Monongahela River
in 1846, which was replaced in 1883, and the Sixth Street
Bridge over the Allegheny River in 1859.
In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad initiated rail service
between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, reducing the travel
time to only 13 hours. The railroads quickly made the canals
obsolete and the canal system was eventually sold at a loss
to the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1857. They briefly ran the
system and then shut it down, using some sections for rail
lines and continuing to operate other sections. The last canal
section near Harrisburg was shut down in 1901.
The canal tunnel that carried the canal from the Al
legheny to Monongahela Rivers was uncovered during the
foundation excavation for the USX Tower (built as the head
quarters office of US Steel) in 1967 (now UPMC Building).
Figure 45 shows the tunnel as it was exposed during con
struction along with a nearby rail tunnel.
River Navigation Structures
Since early settlement of western Pennsylvania, the
three rivers (Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio) have
served the region for basic transportation and shipment of
goods and cargo on barges; pushed by towboats (or tows).
The amount of coal transported down river from Pittsburgh
increased greatly following the Civil War (Johnson, 1978).
The size of the tows also grew with the amount of coal
hauled with increasing downriver demand.
Due to the escalating coal trade, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers began studying methods to produce a reliable
navigation depth on the Ohio River. The Corps launched an
international study to analyze other navigation projects world
wide. The study led to the determination that construction of
an integrated system of locks and dams, each forming down
stream pool (defined as a reach of artificially deepened river)
was the best solution to meet the demands of a growing nav
igation industry. The increased storage capacity of each pool
increased the amount of river water that could be managed
by sequential release from each pool proceeding down river.
Opening of the first lock and dam on the Ohio River at
Davis Island in 1885, located immediately downstream of
Pittsburgh, proved to be a significant technologic advance
Figure 45. Tunnels exposed during USX Tower foundation construction (Rathke, 1968).

for the civil engineering profession at large. At Davis Is
land Lock and Dam, the wooden timber wicket dam was
almost 1900 feet long and the dimensionstone masonry
lock, 600feet long and 110feet wide, was the worlds
largest river navigation structure at that time. Even then
the stonemasonry lock at Davis Island was wider than the
reinforced concrete locks built in 1914 at the Panama Ca
nal (Johnson, 1978).
In 1910, the Rivers and Harbors Act was passed by
Congress, providing for the systematic construction of a
system of locks and dams along the Ohio River. The project
produced 51 wooden wicket dams and typical lock cham
bers of 600feet long by 110feet wide along the length of
the river starting at Pittsburgh. Wicket dams were composed
of moveable slab sections that were hinged at the bottom
and held upright by adjustable props. Wicket dams in the
Pittsburgh region were the earliest to be replaced by mass
concrete dams.
Taken together, the systems of locks and dams on the
three rivers of the Pittsburgh region have been described as
rivers that are highways. Even today, they are the most ef
ficient and costeffective means to move bulk commodities
such as coal, and construction aggregates. Throughout the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Monongahela River
has carried a greater tonnage than any other inland river in
America (Johnson, 1978). In comparison with the mighty
Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, the Monongahela River was
called the Little Giant because of the tonnage it transport
ed annually. Moving coal to steel mills in the western Penn
sylvania towns upstream and downstream of Pittsburgh was
of great importance, especially to the war effort in the late
1930s and early 1940s.
During the 1940s, a shift from steampropelled to die
sel powered towboats allowed for larger tows on the river.
However, this meant that tows had to be disassembled in or
der to lock all the barges through in multiple lockages, then
reassembled before continuing. This functional inconve
nience created backed up river traffic and increased expens
es for the river tow boat industry. Even as modernization
of locks in the lower Ohio River was initiated in the 1950s
to handle the larger tows, the locks in the Pittsburgh region
remained unchanged. In the upper Ohio River, nearest Pitts
burgh, each river navigation dam, being of a gated type or a
simple concrete weir, has two parallel, adjoining locks; one
600feet by 110feet main chamber and a 360feet long by
56feet wide auxiliary chamber.
The Pittsburgh District Corps of Engineers currently op
erates and maintains 23 locks and dams on the three rivers
(See Figure 46). This represents the largest number of nav
igation projects in any district of the Corps and it system
atically provides a 9foot minimum depth navigation pool
depth. In the 1990s a new lock and dam project was built
on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh. The project
was Grays Landing Locks and Dam, and involved tradition
al cofferdam construction. Steel sheet piles, driven to rock
were used to form a series of interconnecting coffer cells.
Once completed, the inner cofferdam area was pumped dry.
Excavation of alluvial sediments was carried down to top of

bedrock. At these variable depths, additional rock removal
was continued in order to establish a foundation within com
petent bedrock. Once the final excavation was performed
concrete was placed on the prepared rock foundation.
Recent construction on the Monongahela River in
volved the 2004 completion of a new gated dam on the
Monongahela River, known as Braddock Locks and Dam,
located 11 miles upstream of Pittsburgh. This project em
ployed innovative floatin construction techniques which
involved two large precast segments set down on nearly
90 reinforced concrete drilled shafts embedded 16 feet into
bedrock (Edwardo et al., 2002). In addition, construction is
currently underway at Charleroi Locks and Dam, located 40
miles upstream of Pittsburgh, which will provide two new
lock chambers 720feet long by 84feet wide.
Rail Systems
The regional topography, consisting of major rivers,
steep hillsides and flat hilltops, has resulted in a unique
transportation infrastructure in Pittsburgh that includes
roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads, inclines, bike paths and
stairways. Pittsburghs strategic location as a Gateway to
the West resulted in use of the rivers as the primary trans
portation corridors, as they still are today.
When Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city in 1816, it
was the major center for commerce in the west, and most
travel from the east coast went through it. Around 1830, the
commerce aspect of Pittsburghs economy was surpassed by
its manufacturing base. To transport bulk goods, including
coal, an economical and reliable mode of transportation was
needed. The first rationally designed transportation network
was the local railroad. This system was intended to trans
fer coal and goods to the industries within and surround
ing Pittsburgh. Topography initially restricted population
growth to the city and railroad corridor expansion to the riv
er valleys. However, with the development of the abundant
Pittsburgh Coal Seam, which resulted in newly established
farm roads and communities in these mining areas, the rail
road lines began following the contours of the nearly flat
lying Pittsburgh Coal Seam. Bridge structures developed as
the railroads required jumping from one hillside to an
other to be in close contact with the mining areas. Like all
other railroads of that time, they relied on horses or mules
for power. Not much faster than wagons or canal boats, their
main advantage was smoothrunning rails.
The transition to the widespread interstate railroad sys
tem was a long battle. Pennsylvania had no urgent reason
to invest in railroad technology until 1825, when the Erie
Canal linked New York Citys ports to Midwest markets
(Finch, 1925). Once the Erie Canal opened, shipping costs
from New York to the Midwest dropped significantly, and
the time it took to ship the goods was cut significantly. This
greatly increased trade for New York City businesses while
bypassing Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
Shipping by water was still cheaper than by rail, but
the railroads did have the advantage of traveling where riv
ers didnt flow. A result was using trains and rivers togeth
er (Fleming, 1928). Started in 1834, the stateowned Main
Line of Public Works used canal boats where possible on
relatively level ground and a combination of gravity and
stationary steam engines where necessary in the mountains
(Baer, 1996). This patchwork of canals, railroads, and in
clined planes offered a 3 to 4 day journey from Philadelphia
to Pittsburgh. But it was soon ended by the cheaper, allpur
pose, allweather railroads. The interstate railroads entered
the area in the 1850s. In 1852, the Ohio and Pennsylvania
Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny
City (presentday North Side), and in 1854, the Pennsylva
nia Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadel
phia. An historical map of the Pittsburgh railroads is shown
in Figure 47. A journey between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
now took only 13 hours. The Pennsylvania Railroad was the
largest railroad in the world for much of its 121year life
span, absorbing many other railroads as it grew. It hauled
more freight and passengers than any other railroad in the
world during that time. (Baer, 1996)
The railroad system in Pittsburgh flourished for many
years. From the beginning of the industrial era through its
collapse in the 1980s, Pittsburgh was always a key market
for the nations largest and most important railroads. At one
time, up to 22 railroads, including main lines and branch
es, entered Pittsburgh (Fleming, 1928). They comprised
the lines of the Pennsylvania System, the New York Cen
tral Lines, the Baltimore and Ohio, the Buffalo, Rochester
and Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh, Bessemer and Lake Erie (the
Carnegie Road), and the Wabash. However, with the coming
of publicly funded highways and the availability of auto
mobiles after World War II, railroads began a long down
ward slide. Despite the near collapse of heavy industry in
the northeast, Pittsburgh still remains an important link in
the nations rail network. Current railroads in Pittsburgh in
clude: Norfolk Southern, CSX, Amtrak, Wheeling  Lake
Erie and the Allegheny Valley Railroad.
Another rail system that once existed in Pittsburgh was
the intercity trolley car. It started in the late 1800s and ear
ly 1900s and followed both the farm roads lying at the ridge
tops, the alignments of the railroad network, and many aban
doned railroad corridors. They became most popular in the
1940s and 1950s as an economical mass transit solution for
the expanding Pittsburgh (See Figure 48). A fleet of more than
600 trolleys were in use in 1948 (Bennear, 1995). The demise
of the trolley was due to the speed and flexibility of gasoline
powered buses. By the early 1970s, the fleet had dwindled to
95 cars and 4 lines. By 1985 almost all trolley rails were over
lain by asphalt, with few cars and lines existing. Today, a light
rail system in Pittsburgh known as the T has replaced rem
nants of the trolley lines. These lines run between downtown
Pittsburgh and the South Hills suburbs. In town these lines

become Pittsburghs subway. The most recent addition includ
ed a tunnel under the Allegheny River to the north side of
Pittsburgh as described in the section of this paper on tunnels.
Inclines
In the mid to late 1800s, the land on the floodplains
within and surrounding Pittsburgh had become crowded by
industrial and commercial development. Land for residen
tial housing was available on the tops of the surrounding
bluffs, such as on Mount Washington (Coal Hill), but tra
versing the 300 to 400 feet of elevation change was arduous.
The answer to this situation was inclined railways or funicu
lars, which are referred to as inclines in the Pittsburgh area.
The inclines are composed of two parallel sets of railway
tracks with a car on each track. The cars are connected by
a single cable that passes through a pulley at the top of the
incline. The cars counterbalance one another so that the en
gine that moves the cars only needs to overcome the weight
difference in the cars plus any frictional forces.
The first incline built in Pittsburgh, the Monongahela
Incline, opened on May 28, 1870. From that time until the
opening of the last incline in 1901, between 15 and 20 in
clines were built in Pittsburgh (Old Pittsburgh MapsPitt
viewer, 2012). Most of the inclines were built to negotiate
the steep bluffs on the south side of the Monongahela River
but a few were built on the north side of the City to the
north of the Allegheny River. Most of the inclines were built
solely for passengers but some were built for freight. The
Monongahela passenger incline had a companion freight in
cline that was built and remained in service until 1935.
The inclines fell out of use as personal vehicles became
common, and most of them were closed during the first half
of the twentieth century. Only two, the Monongahela and
the Duquesne inclines, remain in operation. Both are located
on the south side of the City.
The Monongahela incline is 635 feet long with a grade
of 78 percent (38 degrees) and an elevation change of just
over 367 feet (See Figure 49). It is owned and operated by
Figure 48. August 1964 photo taken along the PWVRR tracks looking down at a Pittsburgh Railways inbound Shannon trolley.

the Port Authority of Allegheny County and has been in
constant operation since it was constructed. It has under
gone major renovations and upgrades.
The Duquesne incline is located opposite the Point. It is
793 feet long with a grade of 58 percent (30 degrees) and an
elevation change of 400 feet. The Society for the Preserva
tion of the Duquesne Heights Incline raised money in 1963
to save the incline. It still has the same Victorian cars with
the original woodwork. The engines have been converted
from steam to electric power.
Bridges
(by Thomas Leech, P.E., Gannett Fleming, Inc.)
In Pittsburgh, bridges are all around us. Allegheny
County, including the city of Pittsburgh, has over 2,000
bridges of varying types, materials and sizes. Some bridges
are quite new; others are quite old. Some are distinct and
magnificent; others are quite ordinary.
There is something intensely dramatic and fanciful in
the appeal of the bridge to all classes of people, under all
conditions of nature. All traffic converges and concentrates
on the bridges. They become a daily necessity and a famil
iar benefactor, giving convenient passage over some natural
obstruction.
(Kidney, 1999).
Many bridges have seen a service life well over 100
years. Many replace one or even two earlier bridges at the
same site. Each bridge records in its composition, in essence,
a genetic code of its era of construction. This genetic code
records both an engineering and architectural imprint of the
age that it was built. All of these bridges, have been distinct
ly shaped by both the geography and geology of the area.
River Crossings
The Monongahela River (i.e. river with sliding banks
Delaware Native American) and the Allegheny River (i.e. riv
er of the Alligewi  Delaware Native American) form the Ohio
River (i.e. the good river  Seneca Native American) at the
Figure 49. Monongahela Incline.
45
Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
Point in Pittsburgh (Bright, 2004). At present there are 30
river crossings in the city of Pittsburgh and another 29 riv
er crossings in other communities within Allegheny County.
Pittsburgh rivals other bridge cities of the world, including
Paris with its 38 river crossings within the city proper, and
Venice with its 409 bridges spanning 150 canals, but with only
4 bridges which cross the Grand Canal (Cridlebaugh, 2014).
As Pittsburgh emerged as a city in the early 1800s,
the rivers were a formidable barrier to transportation. The
first river crossings relied on geographic features such as
fording the rivers by way of sand bar islands. These cross
ings were later replaced with ferry service near the fords.
The locations of fords and subsequent ferries later became
sites of the first river bridges constructed in Pittsburgh.
The first established river crossing within Pittsburgh was
the site of the present Smithfield Street Bridge over the
Monongahela River, initially a river ford, which later was
replaced with the nearby Jones Ferry (Cridlebaugh, 2014).
The ferry service was subsequently replaced by a wood
en covered bridge in 1818 that later was destroyed by the
great fire of 1845 (Lorant, 1975). The present Smithfield
Street Bridge, a third generation replacement bridge, is an
elegant lenticular steel truss and an ASCE Civil Engineer
ing Landmark. The present bridge was constructed in 1881
and is recognized as the oldest standing bridge in the city
(Figure 50). The second established ferry, Robinsons ferry,
connected the North Side (previously Allegheny City) with
downtown Pittsburgh, in close proximity to the present 6th
Street Bridge. In 1819 the first span across the Allegheny
River was a wooden covered bridge constructed at this site.
It was ultimately replaced by the present third generation
Sixth Street Bridge, a selfanchored suspension span, one
of the 1928 Three Sisters Bridges, which are recognized
as the only surviving eye bar chain suspension bridges in
America (Figure 51). Quickly, transportation routes de
veloped around these ferry crossings and the rivers of
Pittsburgh now contain a myriad of bridges with unique
structural form and complexity, all of which is a testament
to Pittsburghs prominence as a historic center of Civil En
gineering practice. The main spans of the river crossings
range from 400 feet to 800 feet, consistent with navigation
requirements, and typically the present 59 river crossings
comprise variant steel superstructures, egalitarian trusses
and plate girder bridges and visually appealing tied arch
and suspension bridges.
As Pittsburgh grew to become an industrial power, the
surface transportation routes shifted from town centric to
bypass or through routes as the transportation routes ulti
mately shifted to interstate corridors, presently converging
at the Point in Pittsburgh. Three generations of bridges
have spanned the Monongahela River at the Point, includ
ing the 1875 Point suspension bridge, the 1927 steel cantile
ver truss and the current 1959 Fort Pitt (I279  I376) steel
double deck tied arch. Three generations of bridges also
have spanned the Allegheny River at the Point, including
the 1874 Union, wooden covered bridge, the 1915 two span
steel trussed Manchester Bridge, and the current 1969 Fort
Duquesne (I279) steel double deck tied arch.
The transportation networks within Pittsburgh and the
surrounding communities in Allegheny County required an
array of valley crossings that are supported by nearly 2,000
bridge structures. Many of the valleys are quite steep sided
and many interesting structures were designed with heights
as much as 200 feet above the valley floors and spans reach

ing 300 feet and more. Structural forms include routine steel
and concrete girders, steel box girders, steel trusses, steel
viaducts, and high level steel plate girders. Additionally,
with competent bedrock so close to ground surface even in
the steepest of valley settings, there is ample opportunity
to build structures which rely on lateral thrust principles. A
wide variety of steel rigid frame, steel high level arch and
concrete high level arch bridges can be found in the Pitts
burgh region. An example of a concrete high level arch is
the George Westinghouse Bridge (Figure 52).
Tunnels
Western Pennsylvania has a place in tunnel history. The
first railroad tunnel in the United States was the Staple Bend
Tunnel, which is located about 60 miles east of Pittsburgh
along the Conemaugh River near Johnstown, Pennsylvania
(National Park Service, 2013). It was excavated between 1831
and 1833 as part of the Allegheny Portage Railroad, which
was part of the Pennsylvania Canal that connected Philadel
phia to Pittsburgh. The same Pennsylvania Canal also had a
tunnel under downtown Pittsburgh. It is located under Grants
Hill, which is now Grant Street in the downtown area. The
tunnel still exists, but is sealed (See Figure 45). The PA Ca
nal Tunnel, which was constructed between 1827 and 1830, is
considered Pittsburghs oldest transportation tunnel.
Today Pittsburgh has 11 tunnels according to the Pitts
burgh Bridges and Tunnels website (Cridlebaugh, 2014).
See Figure 53 for the tunnel locations.
From Pittsburgh to the east the tunnels include:
1)  Panhandle Railroad Tunnel  Under Grants Hill in
Downtown Pittsburgh in rock belonging to the Cassel
man Formation of the Conemaugh Group  now sealed.
2)  Armstrong Tunnel  An automobile tunnel under
Duquesne University on the Bluff just east of down
town Pittsburgh in rock of the Casselman Formation
from the Conemaugh Group. It is a prominent tunnel
in Pittsburgh known mostly for the approximate 45
degree bend. It was built in 192627, with a length
of approximately 1,320 feet. The bend was created to
avoid possible mines, some property rights (includ
ing Duquesne University), and to connect alignments
with existing or proposed roads.
3)  LTV South Side Works Railroad Tunnel  Owned
by CSX and is a cutcover tunnel with cut stone side
walls and a steel beam ceiling located under the
South Side Section of Pittsburgh.
4)  Neville Street Tunnel (or Schenley Railroad Tunnel)
Used by CSX and is a cutcover tunnel located in the
Oakland Section of Pittsburgh about 70 feet below
grade of Neville Street.
5)  Squirrel Hill Tunnel  An automobile tunnel under
the Squirrel Hill Section of Pittsburgh through rock of
the Casselman Formation from the Conemaugh Group.
From Pittsburgh to the west the tunnels include:
6)  Corliss Street Tunnel  An automobile tunnel
through the Norfolk Southern Railroad embankment,
located in the West End Section of Pittsburgh.
7)  Fort Pitt Tunnel  An automobile tunnel through
Mount Washington in rock of the Casselman Forma
tion from the Conemaugh Group.
8)  Wabash Tunnel  Built in 190204 for the Wa
bashPittsburg Terminal Railroad through Mt. Wash
ington, now retrofitted for automobile traffic. Vertical
wall horseshoe profile, concrete lining, 3,342 feet
long through rock of the Casselman Formation from
the Conemaugh Group.
9)  Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel  Port Authority
T and South Busway, through Mount Washing
ton, built in 1904 with a concrete lined vertical wall
horseshoe profile, was excavated through rock of the
Casselman Formation from the Conemaugh Group,
with an approximate length of 3,500 feet.
10)  Port Authority North Shore Connector  Under
the Allegheny River between downtown Pittsburgh
and Pittsburghs North Shore. It is the latest tun
nel constructed in Pittsburgh as part of the T and
subway system. The construction was completed in
2012, with a total length of approximately 1.2 miles.
It includes elevated structures and cut and cover con
struction on the two ends. A tunnel boring machine
was used for the twin tunnels under the river with
about 20 to 25 feet of rock cover at its maximum
depth through rock of the Glenshaw Formation from
the Conemaugh Group. Digging through glacialflu

vial gravel and rock, the working face was stabilized
with a pressurized bentonitewater slurry. The exca
vated material was transported by the slurry through
pipes back to a separation plant above ground where
sand and gravel were separated from the slurry.
11)  Liberty Tunnel  An automobile tunnel through
Mount Washington in rock of the Casselman For
mation from the Conemaugh Group.
Much of the heaviest automobile traffic is associated
with the tunnels, which is ironic because these structures
were supposed to reduce driving time. Notable tunnels of
the area include the Liberty Tunnel, which connects the
south suburbs to the city and the two interstate I376 high
way tunnels (Squirrel Hill and Fort Pitt), which connect the
east and west suburbs to the city.
Mount Washington is nearly 400 feet high along the
length of Pittsburghs downtown area, and posed a barrier
to the development of the South Hills. In order to provide
access, the Liberty Tunnel, which is considered to be the first
modern automobile tunnel in the United States, was excavat
ed through Mount Washington. It consists of twin concrete
lined tunnels in a vertical wall horseshoe profile. The coun
ty began construction of the tunnel in the winter of 1919,
and the excavation was completed in July 1922. The rock
excavated was mostly green and red claystone and soft
laminated sandstone of the Casselman Formation from the
Conemaugh Group, with a minor amount of more competent
blue sandstone (Public Works, 1921). Most of the excava
tion was considered treacherous due to the poor condition
of the soft rock. The tunnels are 5,889 feet long, 28.6 feet
wide and 20.8 feet clearance in the arch portion of the tun

nels, with a 14.5 feet vertical entrance clearance. It opened
in 1924 with restricted use until the ventilation system was
completed in 1925. The tunnel was owned by Allegheny
County and was transferred to the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation (PennDOT).
Construction of the Squirrel Hill Tunnel was started pri
or to the Second World War, and was delayed until after the
war and was completed in 1953. Figure 54 shows the tunnel
excavation. It is the principal highway route from the eastern
suburbs of Pittsburgh into the city. The cost to construct the
tunnel was 18 million and was the most costly project by
the State Highways Department at that time. The tunnel con
sists of twin archshaped reinforced concrete bores that are
4,225 feet long, approximately 29 feet wide, with a ceiling
height of 13.5 feet. Vertical clearances are changing with the
current rehabilitation project. The tunnel design was based
on subsurface evaluations made from conventional borings
which revealed rather poor quality rock would be encoun
tered in excavating the tunnels. To adequately support the
conditions, permanent steel supports were installed as the
tunnel lining, and grout was placed outside of that lining.
The grout was used to impregnate, strengthen, and seal the
weak and shattered rock adjacent to the tunnel (PennDOT
District 11 website, 2014 summary update).
The Fort Pitt Tunnel goes through Mount Washington,
formerly Coal Hill. It is unique in that on the downtown side
of the tunnel, the outbound portal is lower than the inbound
portal. The downtown portals are vertically offset to accom
modate traffic of the stacked deck from the Fort Pitt Bridge
while the westbound portals are at the same elevation. The
Fort Pitt Tunnel is similar in design to the Squirrel Hill Tun
nel. Construction of the Fort Pitt Tunnel started in 1957 and
was completed in 1960 by the PA Department of Highways at
a cost of 17 million. The total length of the tunnels is 3,614
feet, with an estimated opening of each portal at 28 feet wide
with a ceiling height of 13.5 feet. The Fort Pitt Tunnel is re
garded as the best way to enter an American city, because
motorists emerging from the tunnel are suddenly presented
with a dramatic view of Pittsburgh (Lorant, 1964).
MAJOR ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
Foundations
The topography and geology of Pittsburgh result in
many foundation types being used to support structures.
The type and size of structure, sitespecific conditions,

Geology of Pittsburgh
local practice, and the designers preference may influ
ence the type of foundation selected as much as geology.
There are areas where special foundation problems such as
soft soils, subsidence due to mining, expansive shale and
landslides exist. In general, residual soils throughout Pitts
burgh are adequate to support the foundations of homes and
lightcommercial buildings. For heavy foundation loads,
rock normally provides adequate support, except where
deeply weathered. Some local claystones and shales slake
or dry out when exposed to the atmosphere and require im
mediate covering to avoid further deterioration and addi
tional excavation. Pile driving can shatter these shales and
claystones, and piles may have to be redriven several times
before deeper competent rock is encountered. A foundation
designer must consider both surface and underground min
ing as potential sites for differential settlement, subsidence,
slope instability, mine and refuse fires, acidic soil, rock and
water. Shales should be considered a foundation problem
until their potential for heaving is determined.
The alluvial soils in the Monongahela River drainage
are generally soft and large structures normally require
foundations extending to or into rock to avoid excessive
settlements. The glacial gravels in the Allegheny and Ohio
River Valleys are generally dense and can carry significant
foundation loads with only minor settlement. These dense
glacial sand and gravel deposits occur in downtown Pitts
burgh. In the area between the rivers, the contours of the top
of rock rise away from the rivers, and the sand and gravel
deposit ends around Smithfield Street between Fourth and
Sixth Avenues, as shown in Figure 20 (Van Tuyl, 1951).
A variety of foundation types have been used to support
buildings on the dense glacial gravel in downtown Pitts
burgh. They include spread footings, a mat foundation and
friction piles. However, the three Gateway office buildings
adjacent to Point State Park are an anomaly in that they are
supported on HPiles driven through the glacial gravels to
rock. Where the dense glacial gravel is not present, east
of Smithfield Street, buildings are generally supported by
spread footings or drilled piers bearing on rock.
In recent years, larger scale projects including the Brad
dock Dam, the Consol Hockey Arena, the U.P.M.C. East
hospital and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Bridge crossing
the Allegheny River have been constructed. The size of the
projects justified the use of Osterberg Load Cell Tests to de
termine the bearing and side shear properties for optimizing
the design of drilled piers in rock.
Some sites and projects of interest are described as
follows:
Point State Park
Point State Park comprises 36 acres at the confluence
of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. The park recog
nizes Pittsburghs past and present, including the strategic
importance and historic role the Pittsburgh Point had in the
development of the United States. The Ohio River afford
ed great influence over more than 200,000 square miles of
undeveloped territory downstream of the Point. In the early
1800s swarms of settlers moved through Pittsburgh on their
way west. Traffic down the Ohio River reached a volume
of more than 1,000 boats a year leaving Pittsburgh, with
20,000 people and more than 12,000 head of livestock, wag
ons, provisions and household goods.
Following capture of the French Fort Duquesne in 1758,
the English proceeded to construct the most impressive fort
on the American Frontier, Fort Pitt. Point State Park includes
parts of the Fort Pitt Bastions, and the original Fort Pitt Block
House Built in 1764. The Fort Pitt Blockhouse is the oldest
architectural landmark in Pittsburgh and is the nations only
authenticated preRevolutionary War structure west of the
Appalachian Mountains (Pennsylvania Department of Natu
ral Resources, 2015). Much of the structure is intact, includ
ing the stone foundation, brick, and timber elements that are
largely original to its 1764 construction. In addition, the Park
contains a fountain, dedicated in 1974, said to be the largest
in the United States, which propels water upwards approxi
mately 200 feet (Figure 55). The 73,000 gallons of water in
the closedloop system are drawn from glacial gravels 50
feet beneath the Point (Compressed Air Magazine, 1974).
U.S. Steel Building
The U.S. Steel Building, also known as the U.S. Steel
Tower, is a 64 story (841.0 feet high) skyscraper located on
Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh. Construction started
in March 1967, and was completed September 30, 1971. At
841 feet, the U.S. Steel Building was the tallest building be
tween New York and Chicago until 1987. The building site
occupies a portion of Grants Hill, a prominent feature in the
early history of Pittsburgh. In September 1758, Major James
Grant led an advance column of 800 men of British Gener
al John Forbes army against Fort Duquesne. The British
force was repelled on a hill east of the Point with 342 men
killed, wounded or captured. Major Grant was captured, but
paroled soon after. When General Forbes occupied the aban
doned Fort Duquesne on November 25, 1758, the nearby
site of the battle was named Grants Hill (Pittsburgh, 2008).
Grants Hill was leveled on several occasions, a total
of approximately twenty feet. Excavation for the U.S. Steel
Building foundation excavation extended into rock and the
final foundation for the structure was placed on bedrock.
The excavation uncovered two tunnels which had been
constructed through Grants Hill (Figure 45). One was an
810 foot Pennsylvania Canal tunnel constructed in 1834.
The second was the Pittsburgh and Steubenville Exten
sion Railroad tunnel. This railroad was a link between the
Pennsylvania Railroads western terminus and the eastern
terminus of the Steubenville Railroad Company. When this
rail link opened in 1865, it extended the Pennsylvania Rail
roads trade and transportation network into Ohio, as far
51
Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka
as Columbus. This tunnel was built using cutandcover. A
trench, approximately thirtyfive feet wide, was excavated
from the ground surface to elevation 780 feet and the tun
nel was constructed within the trench, then the excavation
was backfilled. The average height of the tunnel side walls
was eighteen feet. A fivecourse brick arch was supported
on the walls. The railroad tunnel was rehabilitated to serve
as an underground rightofway and station area (Midtown
Station) for the Light Rail Transit Subway (HAER, 1985).
During the 196567 construction of the U.S. Steel
Building, a new single track tunnel, measuring 409 feet long
and 17.4 feet wide, was built within the subterranean levels
of the building as part of Pittsburghs Light Rail Subway.
The support systems for the tunnel and the building were
designed to be independent of each other, so that train vi
brations would not disturb the buildings structural integrity
and the weight of the building would not bear on the tunnel.
The U.S. Steel Building tunnel begins 1,029.6 feet from the
south portal, is rectilinear in design, and has two safety bays
measuring one foot deep and approximately five feet wide.
The U.S. Steel Building made history by being the first
to use liquidfilled fireproofed columns. U.S. Steel delib
erately placed the massive steel columns on the exterior of
the building to showcase a new product called Corten steel.
Corten resists the corrosive effects of rain, snow, ice, fog,
and other meteorological conditions by forming a coating of
dark brown oxidation over the metal, which inhibits deeper
penetration and doesnt need painting and costly rustpre
vention maintenance over the years. The initial weathering
of the material resulted in a discoloration of the surrounding
city sidewalks, as well as other nearby buildings. A clean
up effort was conducted by the corporation once weathering
was complete to undo this damage, but the sidewalks still
have a decidedly rusty tinge. The CorTen steel for the build
ing was made at the former U.S. Steel Homestead Works.
The building contains over 44,000 tons of structural steel
(U.S. Steel Tower, 2015).
Subway
Pittsburghs subway system was constructed in the early
1980s. The projects goal was to upgrade the citys streetcar
lines into a modern 10.5 mile long light rail transit (LRT)
system with two connecting exclusive bus roadways. Most
of the rail system is in the suburbs south of the Monongahe
la River and is almost entirely on nonexclusive right of way
at grade. After crossing the river into downtown Pittsburgh
the transit line dives into a 1.1 mile long Yshaped subway
layout consisting of new and renovated twotrack tunnels.
This portion of the project accounted for only about one sev
enth of the projects 480 million cost.
The Port Authority of Allegheny County held the cost
down by purchasing an old railroad bridge across the riv
er along with a tunnel that ran north across the city. New
subway work, all cutandcover, included building the large
Midtown Station at the intersection of the subway Y and a
line running east through Wood Street Station and terminat
ing at Gateway Center.
One of the most challenging sections was the Wood
Street Station, extending out below storage vaults under the
sidewalks to adjacent building lines. The Hayward Baker
Co. conducted the work and it represented the largest chem
ical grouting job ever performed in the U.S. to that date
(Karol, 2003). This 2.5 million job was a showcase for
nondestructive testing. Work was monitored by the cross
hole seismic method. Hayward Baker injected a 13,000 sqft
area beneath Sixth Avenue with 1 million gallons of chemi
cal grout, turning the sand and gravel into a solid matrix that
was excavated without danger while shoring up six adjacent
buildings. The grout consisted of a proprietary formulation
of sodium silicate and a number of reactants. The subway
was completed in late 1984.
The North Shore Connector is a lightrail extension that
opened in 2012. The connector extends the Pittsburgh Light
Rail system from its previous terminus at Gateway Center
Station in the Central Business District to the new North
Side Station and Allegheny Station on the North Shore by
way of a tunnel under the Allegheny River.
The North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh evolved
from a sea of asphalt in the 1990s to a bustling extension
of the central business district reflecting approximately one
billion dollars of investment and construction in the first
decade of the 2000s (Schmitz, 2010; ONeill, 2008). The
North Shore Connector links Pittsburghs previously exist
ing light rail network to the new businesses and attractions
of the North Shore, serving commuters, visitors, and sports
event attendees alike (Fontaine, 2012).
The North Side Station serves PNC Park (1.75 million
annual baseball fans) and the Community College of Allegh
eny County (7,200 students). The Allegheny Station serves
residents in Allegheny West and Manchester, as well as vis
itors to Heinz Field (500,000 annual Steeler fans, exclud
ing concerts), the Carnegie Science Center (700,000 annual
visitors), Childrens Museum of Pittsburgh (250,000 annual
visitors) and the Rivers Casino (Port Authority, North Shore
Connector, 2015). During weekdays, downtowndestined
vehicle commuters utilize the Connector by parking in one
of the many North Shore parking facilities and completing
their commute on the Connector (Shumway, 2012). The
North Shore lacks the parking capacity to serve additional
sports fans, so that the North Shore Connector helps alleviate
the congestion by making it easier for fans to park Down
town and travel to the North Shore Stadium (Lord, 2010).
The new subway section was constructed by cut and
cover from the Gateway Center, 400 feet to the Stanwix
Street receiving pit. The subway construction consisted of
twin bored tunnels, 22 feet in diameter from the Stanwix
Street receiving pit to the West General Robinson launch
pit, a length of 2,240 feet including 875 feet beneath the Al
52
Geology of Pittsburgh
legheny River. From the General Robinson Street launch pit,
the subway was constructed by cut and cover for a distance
of 1,200 feet. From this north portal the line is elevated for
2,000 feet to Allegheny Station. Figure 56 shows a map of
the tunnel alignment and Pittsburghs subway stations.
The top of the twin tunnels lies 2025 feet below the riv
er bed. The German tunnel boring machine (TBM) assem
bly began in November 2007. The TBM, measuring 200 feet
long and weighing 500 tons, was lowered into a 55foot
deep launch pit excavated near the intersection of West Gen
eral Robinson Street and Mazeroski Way near PNC Park.
The TBM began work in January 2008 (Wargo et al., 2009).
In July 10, 2008, the TBM holed through into the re
ceiving pit at Stanwix Street near Penn Avenue downtown.
The machine was hoisted by crane, turned around and be
gan digging the second parallel tunnel September 3, arriving
back at the North Side launch pit January 15, 2009. Com
pleting the second tunnel in 4.5 months showed the bene
fit from experiences gained; the second tunnel was a full
month faster than the first.
The laserguided, slurry pressure balanced, mixed shield
TBM had a 22foot diameter rotating head (typically 1 RPM),
featuring 17inch cutters, driven by electric motors. Digging
through glacialfluvial gravel and rock, the working face was
stabilized with a pressurized bentonitewater slurry; the ex
cavated material was transported by the clay slurry through
pipes back to a separation plant above ground. Excavated sand
and gravel were separated from the slurry, allowing the slurry
to be reused and the other materials to be reserved for future
use elsewhere. The TBMs cutting face had a diameter that
was one inch larger than the rest of the machine. This small
annulus reduced side friction of the TBM shield, enabling it to
move more easily, assisting in steering the machine, and thus
controlling alignment (Wargo et al., 2009). The TBM was
generally operated in two 12hour shifts, five days a week,
averaging 34 feet per day. As the front of the TBM cut, a steel
shield in the trailing section held the cavity open and 4foot
wide, precast concrete segments were bolted together to form
the tunnel liner (seven segments complete the circumference
of a given ring). The TBM then used hydraulic legs to push off
the placed concrete rings as it moved forward. The complete
mining assembly measured approximately 150 feet from the

cutter head to the end of the trailing gantry system.
Paralleling the western side of Mazeroski Way, the
2,240 feet TBM section of the tunnel passes below the
Equitable Resources building. The tunnel descends on a
6.6 perecnt grade from the North Shore to a depth of 69 feet
(25 feet river depth, 22 feet further to top of 22foot diame
ter tunnel bore). Below the Allegheny River, the path turns
left then right, about 45 degrees each time, to align with
Stanwix Street. The tunnel ascends a 7.6 perecnt grade to
arrive at the Gateway station. Figure 57 shows a photograph
of the completed North Shore Connector tunnel.
The key challenges of the North Shore Connector proj
ect included threading the tunnels through pile supported
foundation of a downtown Pittsburgh landmark building;
passing under the 25 foot deep Allegheny River and tunnel
ing beneath a busy downtown street adjacent to Penn Av
enue Place, an historically important building founded on
spread footings. In addition, controlling ground movement
to mitigate the potential for damage to buildings was of par
amount importance (Wargo et al., 2009).
The North Shore Connectors original budget was esti
mated at 350 Million. The final cost was 523.4 million.
(Schmitz, 2010.)
Dams
The Ohio River Flood Board established by the Federal
Government in 1912, examined many strategies for man
aging stream flow within the Ohio River basin in terms of
flood control, navigation, power, irrigation, and other possi
ble uses. As a result of intense lobbying by the Flood Board,
and with financial cooperation from the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh District Army Corps of Engi
neers (Pittsburgh District) completed its first comprehensive
River Basin Report in 1935. The report proposed a series
of dams that would create reservoirs in the headwaters of
the Ohio River basin. This report represented the complete
commitment by the Pittsburgh District to the concept of
dams utilized for multipurpose water resource development
in addition to flood control (Johnson, 1978). Multipurpose
projects can include a combination of flood control, water
flow for reliable navigation, water quality, recreation and
hydropower generation.
Historic flooding has been common in the Pittsburgh
region. Towards noon on St. Patricks Day in 1936, waters
began to fill the valleys in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Much
like the devastating flood of 1889, the narrow, natural, topo
graphic channels of Stoney Creek and the Little Conemaugh

Geology of Pittsburgh
River were incapable of passing much of the rising volume
of flood waters through the City of Johnstown resulting in
major flooding. A scene of inconceivable desolation, fol
lowing devastation by a flood that rivaled the deluge caused
by the historic dam break in 1889 was cited by a reporter
from Engineering NewsRecord in his description of John
stown after the flood (Johnson, 1978). The floodwater surg
es moved downstream to Pittsburgh, where water filled the
downtown and many residents took to boats to navigate the
city streets (See Figure 58). The rivers crested at 46 feet,
which is 30 feet above normal river stage in Pittsburgh, on
March 18, 1936. This flooding surpassed prior record stages
by more than 5 feet, and resulted in flooding of 62 percent of
the downtown Golden Triangle area of the city.
It became clear following the March 1936 flood that
a series of dams and reservoirs were needed to protect the
city from a real and recurring topographically driven flood
threat. Congress passed the federal Flood Water Control Act
of 1936, authorizing and funding these secondary flood con
trol structures, including dams and levees, mostly located
on tributaries to the three major rivers. Several of the dams
built in the Upper Ohio Basin that protect Pittsburgh today
were authorized by this Act. One of the most significant re
tention structures is Kinzua Dam, located on the Allegheny
River near Warren, PA. Other flood control structures au
thorized by this Federal Act include Tionesta Dam, Crook
ed Creek Dam, Conemaugh Dam and Loyalhanna Dam, all
located in the Allegheny River basin above Pittsburgh. In
addition, Youghiogheny Dam, located on a tributary to the
Monongahela River, was also authorized.
Tygart Dam, which also protects Pittsburgh, was under
construction by the Pittsburgh District prior to the Flood
Control Act of 1936. It is located on the Tygart River, a trib
utary to the Monongahela River, at Grafton, West Virginia,
and was completed in 1938 at cost of 18.5 million dollars.
At the time it was built, Tygart Dam was the highest concrete
gravity dam east of the Mississippi River. Tygart Dam is a
multipurpose project which provided significant flood and
flow control to areas downstream, including Morgantown,
West Virginia and ultimately Pittsburgh. Tygart Dam, in ad
dition to the five dams built in response to the Act, formed
the mainstay of comprehensive surface water management
by the Pittsburgh District in the upper Ohio River basin.
Eventually the total number of dam projects constructed
and operated by the Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District
reached the current level of 16. The project which forms
the largest single reservoir in the basin, at a length of over
26 miles, is Kinzua Dam, located on the Allegheny River
near the Pennsylvania  New York border. Kinzua Dam is a
combination concrete gravity and earthrock fill dam and is
what many believe to be one of Dr. Shailer Philbricks finest
foundation designs. Dr. Philbrick was the Pittsburgh Dis
trict Geologist for the design and construction of this dam.
The original siting of the dam axis was more than a mile
upstream from its present day location. Due to the consider
able depth to sound bedrock (siltshale), the original design
called for a rather deep excavation with cofferdam construc
tion and construction of a concrete gravity dam. Dr. Phil
brick conducted a detailed field investigation which included
studying the glacial history of the valley and then planning
and conducting an extensive program of core borings and
geophysical surveys in reaches downstream of the origi
nally selected site. With these data in hand, he proposed an
alternate location for the construction of the dam axis, that
tailored the dam design to the site geologic conditions at a
reduced cost. The design modification was accomplished by
constructing a concrete gravity dam section where bedrock
was shallow on the left side of the valley, and an earthrock
fill embankment on the right side of the valley where bed
rock was much deeper. The concrete gravity dam was cast
in progressive monolithic sections, so as to permit river flow
to continue throughout construction. The embankment was
constructed on alluvial soils with an upstream claysoil blan
ket. The clay blanket was subsequently tied into a concrete
cutoff wall taken to significant depths within the river valley
alluvium. This was the first slurry cutoff wall constructed for
a dam in the United States (Leggett and Karrow, 1983). The
earthrock embankment has a wraparound section that ties
it into the concrete gravity section of the dam. Construction
of the dam was completed in 1965. The project has a pumped
storage hydropower unit that is operated by a private util
ity in cooperation with the Pittsburgh District. The prima
ry purpose of the project is flood mitigation, but the other
uses including water supply, recreation, and hydropower
are carefully balanced to optimize the use of the available
water. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),
Pittsburgh Section bestowed its Outstanding Civil Engineer
ing Award on the project, recognizing its innovation. The
optimized foundation design saved several million dollars.

Engineering Geologists (AEG) Claire P. Holdredge Award

AEG, Dr. Shailer Philbrick and Harry Ferguson, a coworker
and successor as District Geologist, were instrumental in de
veloping efficient foundation designs for most of the flood
control dams located within the Pittsburgh District.
History of Cofferdam Construction
Cofferdams have a long history of use in the Pittsburgh
region, in particular for concrete gravity dams and for the
construction of navigation locks and dams founded on bed
rock. The earliest local cofferdams date back to 1878, with
Federal Government construction of the Davis Island Lock
and Dam, the first navigation project to be constructed on the
Ohio River. Davis Island is located immediately downstream
of Pittsburgh. Between 1878, when construction began, and
1885 when completed, the Davis Island lock and dam project
incorporated seven very rudimentary wooden but successful
cofferdams. OBannon (2009) suggests that the cofferdams
were designed and constructed in conformance with princi
ples outlined in the book: An Elementary Course of Civil En
gineering, for Use of the Cadets of the United States Military
Academy (Mahan, 1837).
Cofferdam construction continued on the three rivers
from the late 1800s to late 1900s and eventually transitioned
from wood to steel sheetpile. From a geological standpoint,
cofferdams permitted complete dewatering, and then open
excavation of river alluvial sediments to reach bedrock and
into the rock until a suitable foundation level was encoun
tered. Once uncovered, standard practice was to clean the ex
posed rock with brushes and high pressure water jets, clean
and treat rock defects with dental concrete, and then to cast
dam base concrete on the prepared surface as soon as prac
tical, as a means to avoid any deterioration by air or water
slaking (in the case of fine grained argillaceous bedrock).
In the later 1990s a highly unique cofferdam was built on
the Monongahela River near the Pennsylvania  West Virginia
border. The old existing navigation lock at Point Marion, PA,
built in 1926, had exceeded its design life. A new, larger lock
was needed to improve both structure reliability and to ensure
continuous river passage. The challenge for the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers was to build a larger lock chamber (84
feet by 720 feet) on the landward side of the older existing
lock chamber (56 feet by 360 feet). Construction of a lock
landward of an existing lock had only been attempted once
before in the United States, in 1961, at General Joe Wheeler
Lock and Dam on the Tennessee River in northern Alabama.
Construction at the General Joe Wheeler Lock and Dam met
with disaster when, during excavation for the new lock, the
land wall of the existing lock slid into the excavation. This
resulted in loss of life and closure of the river to navigation
for several years. The sliding failure was determined to be
related to weak clay shale seams in the underlying limestone,
a condition which had not been identified during the site in
vestigation (Terzaghi, 1962).
The Pittsburgh District undertook similar construction at
Point Marion Lock and Dam with the experience of Wheeler
Lock in mind. Construction of the new lock chamber had to
be accomplished while keeping the existing lock chamber in
service to accommodate ongoing river navigation (Greene
et al., 1993). Three rows of high capacity rock anchors were
installed through the landward wall of the existing lock so
that the wall could be incorporated as a portion of the cof
ferdam for the new lock. Nearly 500 rock anchors were in
stalled in the landward wall of the old lock and anchored into
the underlying claystones, siltstones and sandstones. One
row of vertical anchors was installed prior to excavation and
two rows of inclined anchors were placed as the excavation
was carried two lifts deeper (See Figure 59). A large portion
of the landwall foundation of the existing lock was on clay
stone, and located only 8 feet from the excavation for the
new lock. Therefore, it was of the utmost importance that
the sliding and overturning stability of the existing wall be
improved (Greene et al., 1993). An extensive instrumenta
tion program was installed to monitor movements and water
levels; the program included shear strips, inclinometers, pie
zometers, and load cells placed on selected inclined rock an
chors. The new lock was completed in the early 1990s, and
in 1994, the ASCE Pittsburgh Section awarded Point Marion
Lock and Dam the Outstanding Civil Engineering Achieve
ment Award. This distinction was primarily due to the unique
cofferdam design and construction.
Post Cofferdam IntheWet Construction
In the late 1990s, replacement of the 100 yearold Brad
dock Dam became necessary. Braddock Dam was part of the
Braddock Locks and Dam navigation project, located only
12 miles upstream from Pittsburgh, and is the first lock and
dam on the Monongahela River. Braddock Dam introduced a
new type of inriver construction that did not employ the use
of cofferdams. This project represented innovation and was a
major departure from the proven methods that had been used
for several decades. The Braddock Dam employed floatin

or inthewet construction. The project began in 1999 and
was completed in 2004. It represented the first time in the
history of an inland navigation system that a concrete dam
had been floated into place (Edwardo et al., 2002).
As opposed to traditional inthedry methods of coffer
dam construction, the inthewet method permitted drilled
shaft foundations to be built at the site while the two dam
segments, which were composed of a combination of precast
concrete panels and conventional concrete, were fabricated
at an offsite casting basin located downstream of Pittsburgh.
Eightynine reinforced concrete drilled shafts were installed
within the footprint of the dam. Each shaft was 78 inches in
diameter and 40 feet long, which included a 1520 foot long
drilled rock socket. Approximately twenty percent of the
drilled shafts were affixed with circular form, hydraulic flat
jacks, which were subsequently used to level the segments of
the dam. Once the drilled shafts were completed the concrete
segments were floated upriver, passing through three locks,
to the location of the new dam site (Edwardo et al., 2002).
Segment 1 was a 11,600 ton, 330 foot long by 104
foot wide concrete section of the dam (See Figure 60). The
segment was lowered onto the drilled shaft foundations
by filling the structure with water and sinking it. The seg
mentshaft connections were grouted under water and the
interior of the segment was filled with tremie concrete, thus
displacing the water. A neat cement grout was used to fill
the onefoot void that existed between the base of the dam
and a preplaced graded gravel base under the foot print of
the dam. Steel sheet piles (Ztype) driven to rock at both the
upstream and downstream limits of the dam served as an
additional barrier to prevent seepage under the dam.
Segment 2, which measured 265 feet by 104 feet and
weighed 9,000 tons, was installed in the same manner as
Segment 1.
To complete the Braddock dam project, the existing
100 year old fixed crest dam, located approximately 600
feet downstream, was completely removed to the riverbed
and the demolished concrete used for creation of underwa
ter simulated reefs to promote fish habitat. Another environ
mental aspect of the project was that the dredged material
from the footprint of the new dam was tested and found to
be suitable for riverside disposal. Some 400,000 cubic yards
of dredged material provided cover for the restoration of a
nearby Brownfield site (an abandoned steel mill property).

UNDERGROUND STORAGE
For over a century there has been underground dimen
sionstone mining of the Vanport Limestone, near Pittsburgh.
A number of these abandoned roomandpillar limestone
quarry mines are now used for office space, records storage,
vehicle and RV storage, growing mushrooms, manufacture
of precision telescope lenses, and even the filming of mov

ies (Kochanov and Bragonier, 2005).
The second largest employer in Butler County is the
Boyers underground minestorage facility, which is located
approximately 40 miles north of Pittsburgh. This facility con
tains offices for six different agencies including the Office of
Personnel Management, Social Security Administration, and
The Smithsonian Institution, with a combined onsite payroll
of some 3,000 Federal employees. In addition, this under
ground facility houses a private sector record storage firm.
The worlds largest underground mushroom growing
facility is in Worthington, Pennsylvania, which is located
about 35 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. This repurposed
former limestone quarry mine features a controlled en
try and egress at more than 300 feet below the ground
surface and has been stabilized and improved for produc
tion for as far as threequarters of a mile in from the en
try portal. The entire original mined area consists of about
150miles of throughpillar passageways that had been
created by the termination of the rock production more than
75 years ago. The mine environment, with its constant cool
temperature (62 F) and high humidity, is ideal for growing
mushrooms.
The Wampum Mine facility, which is also located north
of Pittsburgh, is currently used for records storage and was
the site for filming portions of the movie, The Zombies
(Kochanov and Bragonier, 2005). The mine had been used
during the early years of the Atomic Age to store nuclear
materials. The most unique use of the mine occurred in the
late 1990s, when a telescope mirror, which at that time was
the worlds largest singlepiece optical element, was man
ufactured within the Wampum mine. The mirror blank was
initially fabricated by Corning, Inc., and measured over 27
feet in diameter and was about nine inches thick. A Pitts
burgh firm, Contraves, converted a portion of the Wampum
mine into an optical fabrication facility where the mirror
was ground, polished and tested. The mirror was finished
in 1997 and was installed in a telescope at the Mauna Kea
Observatory in Hawaii.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
Abandoned Mine Lands
One unintended and poorly considered legacy of the
mining of the abundant coal resources in the Pittsburgh re
gion are the mining related problems that remain, problems
that are generally referred to as abandoned mine lands or
AML. Included in AML problems are mine subsidence;
unfilled or improperly filled shafts, slopes and drifts; mine
and spoil pile (culm bank) fires; unstable slopes; gas prob
lems stemming from methane, carbon monoxide, carbon di
oxide or hydrogen sulfide; and acid mine drainage.
The coals were mined nearly everywhere in the Pitts
burgh region and now the AML problems are found near
ly everywhere as well. The shallow depth to the Pittsburgh
Coal, its significant thickness and the early mining meth
ods and laws, came together to create an almost ideal envi
ronment for mine subsidence. Much of the area to the east
and south of the city are underlain by shallow, abandoned
room and pillar mining where the overburden thickness is
less than 100 feet and often less than 50 feet. A engineering
based study of subsidence over the Pittsburgh Coal (Gray et
al., 1977) that was completed in 1976 determined that 251
of the 352 documented incidents of subsidence (about 71)
occurred in Allegheny County. This was attributed in part to
the area being one of the earliest undermined and also to be
ing one of the most densely populated sectors of the region.
There are over 34,000 documented AML features in the
state and 296 documented AML sites in Allegheny County
alone. Figure 62 shows that the current number of AML sites
by county in Pennsylvania. As can be seen from Figure 62,
the problem is extensive and the number of AML sites for
all of the surrounding mined counties is similar. Figure 63
shows the distribution of individual AML sites in Allegheny
County. The Federal Office of Surface Mining had defined
three priority levels for prelaw AML sites under the Surface
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
They initiated an inventory of priority 1 (P1) and priority 2
(P2) AML sites which are the sites that are counted and are
shown on Figure 62 and now the State maintains it (PA DEP,
AML). Those sites are generally defined as requiring recla
mation to protect the public health and safety from extreme
danger of the adverse effects (P1) or just from the adverse
effects (P2) of coal mining practices. Priority 3, the sites
requiring restoration of land and water resources because
of environmental degradation previously caused by the ad
verse effects of coal mining, are generally not included in the
AML inventory list. These sites, which include mine water
discharges, abandoned surface mines and abandoned mine
spoil dumps that are not included within P1 and P2 sites, are
considered to have a very low priority for reclamation even
though they are as ubiquitous as the P1 and P2 sites.

Geology of Pittsburgh
Hydrofracturing Fluids Associated with Natural Gas
In recent years there has been a boom in the exploration
and production of natural gas and natural gas liquids associ
ated with the Marcellus Shale Formation (Pennsylvania De
partment of Natural Resources, 2014). Significant secondary
natural gas recovery has resulted from physically improv
ing the permeability of the shale host rock through the pro
cess of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in conjunction with
horizontal drilling (Figure 64). However, there is controver
sy concerning the volume, chemical additives and ultimate
fate of fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) pro
cess. Some 6 to 10 million gallons of fresh water combined
with surfactants, chemical additives, and propping sand are
used to frack a single well, and to keep the induced fractures
open to radially inward flow of formation gas. The actual
volume of water, sand and chemicals used is largely depen
dent on the length of the lateral leg of the borehole. Fluids
used in the hydrofracturing process return to the surface as
flowback fluid, which must be recovered with the enhanced
flow of natural gas, then treated appropriately and disposed
in a regulatorypermitted manner. Major flowback constitu
ents of regulatory concern are released 1) chlorides and 2)
total dissolved solids, both which have been used to finger
print the fluids, if and when they may be detected in surface
water. Some of the drillers have elected to dispose of the
recovered fluids in Class 2 deep injection wells in neighbor
ing Ohio. Prior studies by the Army Corps of Engineers (US
ACE, 2012) have shown that the quality of the Monongahela
River water has been a concern in regards to  the Federal
Clean Water Act (as amended). The Corps has confirmed that
the primary water quality problems within the Monongahela
River watershed are related to acid mine drainage, traditional
gas drilling, industrialmunicipal pollution and in some cas
es Marcellus Shale gas production. State and Federal envi
ronmental agencies are working with the gas drilling firms
to ensure that fair but important environmental limits are
placed on the disposal of flowback recovery fluids.
Low Level Nuclear Waste  Shallow Land
Disposal Area
The Parks Township Shallow Land Disposal Area
(SLDA) site, located approximately 23 miles eastnortheast
of Pittsburgh, encompasses 44 acres of private land present
ly owned by BWX Technologies. Land use within the vicin
ity of the SLDA site is mixed, consisting of small residential
communities, individual rural residences, small farms with
croplands and pastures, idle farmland, forested areas, and
light industrial properties (USACE, 2002).
The Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation
(NUMEC), which was a predecessor of BWX Technologies,
disposed of low level radioactive waste (LLW) materials, gen
erated from national defense programs, onsite between 1961
and 1970 in accordance with Atomic Energy Commission
regulations (predecessor to the present Nuclear Regulatory
Commission). BWX Technologies presently is licensed by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to properly maintain the site
to ensure the protection of caretaker staff and of the general
surrounding public. The SLDA site consists of ten trenches
containing contaminated soil and other waste materials. The
estimated quantity of contaminated waste material from the
trenches is approximately 24,300 cubic yards. This equates to
the area of a football field twelve feet deep. The contaminated
waste included uranium, thorium, americium and plutonium.
In the early 1900s, the Upper Freeport Coal was deep
mined at a depth of 60 to 100 feet beneath the uphill portion
of the site and surface mined later on the downhill portion
(USACE, 2002). Nine of the trenches are on the uphill por
tion of the site in 11 to 16 feet of Pleistocene terrace deposits
that overlie 54 to 80 feet of shale and sandstone, above the
mined Upper Freeport Coal. The tenth trench is in the strip
mine downhill of the other trenches, located within the strip
mine spoil, and rests on a clay and shale layer below the
Upper Freeport Coal.
In January 2002, Congress directed the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to clean up radioactive waste at the SLDA site.
At the time of this writing all of the excavated contaminated
material has been packaged and transported from the project
site to a secure landfill meeting containment requirements of
the Federal RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act of 1976 as amended). The remedial action wastewater
treatment plant (WWTP) has been disassembled and re
moved from the project site. The purpose of the WWTP was
to capture, filter and contain suspended waste particulates
from remedial action wastewater used during remediation
activities (USACE, 2007). A late 2014 contract was planned

CONCLUSION
Pittsburgh has a rich history, and its Three Rivers have
always played a major role in the Citys growth and develop
ment. No longer known as just The Steel City, Pittsburgh
is a major metropolitan area rich with mineral resources
and abundant surface and groundwater supplies. The City
is now vibrant, with a bright future, with new construction
and a greatly improved natural environment. Air quality has
improved, as has the quality of the regions three rivers, the
Allegheny, Monongahela and the Ohio.
Western Pennsylvania enjoys abundant natural re
sources. Coal continues to dominate as the primary source
of energy to fuel power plants. Natural gas produced from
hydrofracturing of shale formations, also is a significant en
ergy resource. Acid mine drainage remains a legacy envi
ronmental impact from past coal mining.
Geohazards are present in the Pittsburgh region, including
slope instability, mine subsidence, expansive shales and slags,
and pyritic acid rock. The local infrastructure is aging and there
is a need to repair major highways, including the Pennsylvania
Turnpike, the oldest interstate in the nation. Pittsburgh is a city
of bridges and many are in need of repair or replacement. The
river navigation system of locks and dams is aging and one
major replacement project is underway on the Monongahela
River, with others being planned for the Ohio River.
Pittsburgh is a city with a bright future as its industrial
base changes and the regions abundant natural resources
are utilized. Water is plentiful and is used in many ways to
benefit and enrich the citizens of the region.

O
f the various claims about who first likened downtown Pittsburgh
to a Golden Triangle, one has primacy. After the Great Fire of 1845
ravaged the citys core, Mayor William Howard is said to have
declared, We shall make of this triangle of blackened ruins a golden triangle
whose fame will endure as a priceless heritage.
The Golden Triangle nickname was already well established locally by
1914, when an article in the Saturday Evening Post gave it national
publicity.
The nickname was a good fit because the 255 acres bounded by Grant
Street and the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers must count among the
most gilded in the United States, having generated immense wealth. The
Triangle constitutes a city in itself, with retail strips on Wood and Smithfield
streets and Forbes and Fifth avenues, a government center on Grant, two
churches and the Duquesne Club on Sixth Avenue, and extensive cultural
facilities set among the castiron fronts and loft buildings on Penn and
Liberty avenues.
The compactness of the Golden Triangle is a marvel in its own right: no
two of its points are more than a fifteenminute walk apart. The subway route
from Grant Street to Gateway Center is so tiny that its entire length is shorter
than the subway platform beneath Times Square in New Y ork.

Being so small, downtown Pittsburgh is the preserve of pedestrians. In
winter, they tend to stay indoors by using the subway and the tunnels, atri
ums, and interior streets of the new buildings. During the other seasons
they move outdoors and enjoy Point State Park or Market Square, which has
been hosting public gatherings since 1784. At noon every day, lunch crowds
descend on Mellon Square,
PPG Place, PNC Plaza, or the plazas set around
the U.S. Steel tower and 625 Liberty. PPG Place was designed as a contem
porary variant of Pariss Place Vendôme, but its main attraction now is a
fountain that doubles in winter as an iceskating rink.
The remaking of the Triangle during the Pittsburgh Renaissance of the
1950s was a closely guarded process, led by Richard King Mellon and
Mayor David L. Lawrence with a largely selftaught staff under Park Martin,
Wallace Richards, and John Robin. The upgrading of the Triangle in the
1980s (the socalled Renaissance II) was, by contrast, a technocratic rather
than an autocratic process, with Mayor Richard Caliguiri and the Urban
Redevelop
ment Authority devising the urban upgrades. The results were
nevertheless substantial: the subway, cosmetic improvements to Grant Street,
the first Lawrence Convention Center (even though it was a functional and
artistic dis
appointment), Liberty Center, Oxford Centre, Mellon Center,
PPG Place, Chatham Center II, Fifth Avenue Place, and 625 Liberty in the
Triangle, with spinoff developments in the Strip, the South Side, and the
North Side. These renewal efforts involved about five times as much build
ing as in the original Renaissance projects in the 1950s.

In the twentyfirst century the Triangle is undergoing a different kind of
change. No longer just a place to which business people commute, it has
recently become home to some three thousand residents, with up to five
times that number projected to move Downtown in the decade beginning in
2010. Across the whole of Downtown and in the adjacent Strip, dozens of
older buildings have been converted to student dormitories, apartments, or
condominiums.
Parking remains a hurdle to Downtown redevelopment, not so much in its
scarcity as its cost. (However, you can park all day in downtown Pittsburgh
for the price of a half hour in midtown Manhattan.) Retail is spotty: the sub
urban malls get most of the trade, and the only large department store still in
Downtown is the Macys that was Kaufmanns for 135 years. Only one movie
theater remains from the dozen of a century ago. Overall, though, entertain
ment and the arts are flourishing Downtown. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust
now manages five updated theaters and concert halls in the Triangle: Heinz
Hall, Benedum Center, the Byham and OReilly theaters, and the Harris
Theater, an art cinema. Finally diversified from its old state as a purely busi
ness center, the Triangles current health is vigorous: where it leads, the rest
of Pittsburgh will follow.

n 1868, Boston journalist James Parton wrote of Pittsburgh, On that
low point of land, fringed now with steamboats and covered with grimy
houses, scarcely visible in the November fog and smoke, modern history
began. Not everyone would agree with Parton that modern history first
announced itself in Pittsburgh. Events of some importance also took place
in Williams
burg, Boston, and Philadelphia, not to mention Athens, Florence,
and Runnymede. But the juncture of the Monongahela and Allegheny
rivers
known as the Forks of the Ohio in the eighteenth
century
was the
setting for three milestones. At that spot in 1758, North America was secured
for the British and not the French. In 1875, Andrew Carnegies revolutionary
steel mill secured the industrial might of the world for the United States and
not Europe. In 1945, there began one of the most striking rebirths of any city
in the country.
The fiftynine acres at the Forks of the Ohio are today split between
Point State Park and Gateway Center, together encompassing twelve office
and residential towers, four bridges over land and water, two military strong
holds, and one of the worlds more vivid fountains. The views across the
water to the South Side and North Side capture the industrial history of
Pittsburgh, while on the land side stands Gateway Center, the starting point
for the citys rebirth in the 1950s. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that
without Gateway Center, the city might have withered to an unrecognizable
husk of its former glory.
The British intended Fort Pitt to be their stronghold in North America,
and its construction became the first great accomplishment in Pittsburgh.
When a military engineer, Captain Harry Gordon, devised it in 1759, he had
the benefit of three centuries of advancement in the science of fortifications,
going all the way back to Renaissance Italy. Gordon gave the fort the shape
of a slightly irregular pentagon with five pointed bastions. The bastions mini
mized cannon fire from direct broadside hits on the long sides and helped pin
down enemy troops before they could storm the walls. Two of the bastions
had walls nearly fifteen feet high and seven and a half feet thick. Those solid
stone walls were faced with 1,244,160 bricks. The fortress walls were keyed
to the kinds of attacks the British anticipated: on the land side, from which
infantry would attack, the walls were of brick and stone; facing the water,
across which cannon would fire, there were earthworks to absorb the blows.
Inside the fort was a parade ground with casemates (underground rooms
framed in timber), magazines, and housing for a thousand men; outside was

a moat with a drawbridge and an earthen embankment. The bricks were made
locally, the stone was quarried locally, and the timber was planed at a stream
in Pittsburghs West End that has ever since been known as Saw Mill Run.
Luckily, the greatest fort England ever built in the Western Hemisphere
was put to the test only once, in Pontiacs Rebellion of 1763. Despite its
elegance, the fort had major problems. The riveroriented earthworks eroded
badly in the spring floods, and none of the bastions proved effective against
snipers.
In 1764, dismayed by the forts poor performance, Colonel Henry
Bouquet constructed five redoubts outside its walls to catch snipers in cross
fire; one of them survives. Fort Pitt and the other four redoubts were allowed
to tumble into ruins just one generation after the French threat ended. When
the Grenadier, Music, and Flag bastions were rebuilt in the 1950s, their plans
and details were based on archaeological observations. Nonetheless, experts
later found fault with the restoration: the Music Bastion was not accurate, the
bricks in the walls being mostly modern, and the moat opposite the Hilton
Hotel was narrower and shallower than the original. These charges were used
as justification for filling in the moat in 2008 in order to expand the area for
concerts and other public events.
The Block House, as Colonel Bouquets surviving pentagonal redoubt is
misnamed, still carries his name and the date 1764 inscribed over the door. It
retains its original sandstone base, a complete rim of wooden girders, and
coursed commonbond brick walls. Iron cranking plates in the walls support
the upper floor, and the diminutive building bears a modern pyramidal roof
of wooden shingles. This glimpse into American colonial
history is the oldest
surviving structure in Pittsburgh.
By the first decades of the nineteenth century, Fort Pitt had been so
thoroughly vandalized that even the earthen ramparts were gone. A few
voices suggested that the Point could be turned into the citys first park, but
the fate of the site was sealed in 1854, when the Pennsylvania Railroad built the
Duquesne Freight Depot directly over the ruins. It would take nearly a
century for the city and state to redevelop the Point for shared use as a his
toric park and an office complex. In 1947, while the development of Gateway
Center was being debated, Edgar J. Kaufmann gave Frank Lloyd Wright a
new commission (they had partnered to create Fallingwater a decade earlier).
Kaufmann wanted renderings for a circular megastructure thirteen levels
high and onefifth of a mile in diameter, with a helical auto ramp that would
have been four and a half miles long. Pittsburgh shied away from this over
sized vision of the future, which would have obliterated the historical relics

at the Point, but it did adopt Wrights ideas for a colossal fountain and twin
bridges crossing the rivers close by. This episode supports the idea that
history
repeats itself, since John Augustus Roebling had proposed a double suspen
sion bridge for the Point a century earlier.
George Richardson, who engineered the Fort Pitt Bridge over the
Monongahela and the Fort Duquesne Bridge over the Allegheny, was a mas
ter of bridge design during his fortyyear career in Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County. Richardson and his design team transformed what might have been
a potentially ugly overpass connecting the two bridges into a luminous portal
of three ultrathin stretched barrel vaults. The tensioning of the prestressed
reinforcing rods in the concrete vaults was so complex that the final calcula
tions of 1962 were personally overseen by the celebrated French bridge
builder Eugène Freyssinet just before his death that same year.
The eyecatching element in Point State Park turned out to be not its fort
but its fountain. All of the planners who had eyed the Point for a hundred
years imagined some focal element here. For Wright, it was a fountain; for
Robert Moses, a shining beacon; for other visionaries it was a colossal sculp
ture
of a steelworker, an allegorical Meeting of the Waters, or the legendary
steelworker Joe Magarac. (Legend holds that Magarac
which is Slovak for
jackass
was the strongest steelworker in Pittsburgh. According to the
tale, he would measure the consistency of a ladle of molten steel by tasting it
and ended his life by leaping into a blast furnace to upgrade the quality of its
iron ore.) What emerged in 1974 was a geyser that normally jets about 150
feet high but can rise
to challenge all aquatic records
to more than 300
feet. It spews 6,000 gallons of water a minute from a 100,000gallon hidden
reservoir fed by an aquifer some 50 feet below ground. (This socalled
fourth river is a staple of Pittsburgh trivia quizzes.) The fountain was not
the only way to accentuate the Point, but since the old Pittsburgh had its
columns of fire and smoke, there is some appropriateness to this play of
waters as a symbol for the cleaner city of today.
Until the 1990s, Pittsburgh was the only city with structures designed by
both of the grand Kahns of American architecture: Albert and Louis. In the
1930s, the industrial architect Albert Kahn put up an important component
of the Heinz factories on the North Side, and in 1976, Louis Kahn (no rela
tion) designed the American Wind Symphonys barge PointCounterpoint II,
which for several decades was docked on the Allegheny River frontage of the
Point. Kahns barge would float down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for
concert tours in the summer. The floating concert hall and musicians dormi
tory was clad in burnished steel, and with its huge portholes, it looked like a

Gateway Center, with the earlier Gateway Plaza and later Equitable
Plaza, was more than a postwar investment by the Equitable Life Assurance
Society; it was a leap of faith in the future of Pittsburgh and
in a way no
longer imaginable
a demonstration of the healing power of modern
architecture. Conceived in 1947, One, Two, and Three Gateway were among
the most talkedabout buildings after World War II because, apart from New
Y orks Rockefeller Center, so large a singleblueprint commercial complex
could be found nowhere else in the world. Also making the leap of faith were
the corporations that signed up as tenants: Jones  Laughlin Steel,
PPG
Industries, Peoples Gas, and Westinghouse, which made their commitments
on the basis of nothing more than a sketch.
The design of these cruciform towers represented a tug of war between
the traditionalists Otto Eggers and Daniel Higgins, both involved with John
Russell Pope in the design of the National Gallery and the Jefferson Memorial
in Washington, and the progressive Irwin Clavan, who in the same years
designed cruciformtower housing estates in New Y ork. Behind Gateway
Center also lies the exemplar of Le Corbusiers towersinthepark scheme
for Paris in 1922. Between seven and fifteen cruciform towers were originally
projected for Pittsburgh, all in traditional brick and limestone. At the last
minute the designs were respecified for stainless steel, but scarcities because
of the Korean War resulted in the use of chromealloyed steel.
When building resumed in Equitable Plaza, across Liberty Avenue, from
1955 to 1968, the landscape architects used a more informal site plan.
However, the continuous perimeter podium they created makes this half of
Gateway Center more difficult to enter from the adjoining streets. The Verizon
Building and the Pennsylvania State Office Building on the plaza are conven
tional office slabs, but the bold shape of Four Gateway, with its long glass
tower and extruded stainlesssteel service wing, is a fine expression of mid
century modernism.
One of the criticisms of Gateway Center (especially in Jane Jacobss The
Death and Life of Great American Cities) is the way it turned its back on the
larger city. Fifth Avenue Place, on the opposite side of Stanwix Street, was the
first building in thirtyfive years to create a visual link with the Gateway
complex rather than standing back from it, as the
PPG and Riverfront Center,
at 20 Stanwix Street, complexes do.

Opposite Fifth Avenue Place, at the corner of Stanwix and Penn, stands
a still fondly remembered remnant of Downtowns retail history. The struc
ture that for a century housed the Joseph Horne Company department store
is today Penn Avenue Place and serves not shoppers but the Highmark medi
cal insurance group (also the main tenant in Fifth Avenue Place). The exterior
is handsome in a conventional BeauxArts way, while the interior was once
striking in its high Tuscan Doric columns with gilded moldings
all now
stripped away. The elaborate brass window surrounds at ground level are not
there just for show: Hornes was devastated by the St. Patricks Day flood that
struck Pittsburgh in 1936. Afterward, these fittings were added so that enor
mous brass plates can be placed over the windows to keep the Allegheny out,
should it rise that high again.
Three important buildings complete Equitable Plaza toward the
Monongahela bank. The United Steelworkers Building is the main monu
ment to organized labor in Pittsburgh, the city in which the Iron  Steel
Workers Union (predecessor of the American Federation of Labor) was
organized in 1876. The union headquarters building, originally constructed
for
IBM, is also a milestone in skyscraper architecture; it shattered a longheld
dogma of skyscraper construction whereby the exterior walls generally did
not support any of the load. For this skyscraper, however, U.S. Steel instead
fabricated an exterior loadbearing wall in place of a conventional curtain
wall. During construction, the three different types of steel in the exterior
walls were painted red, white, or blue to designate their different structural
roles. The midcentury slickness of the design can at times be cloying, but
particularly at night the thirteenstory diamondfaceted walls of stainless
steel hover alluringly over the heavy concrete base.
The union building faces a mildly Gothic brickfaced St. Mary of Mercy
Church on the opposite corner of Boulevard of the Allies and Stanwix. A
harmless legend
possibly even true
holds that the church stands just
where the first Mass in Pittsburgh was celebrated in 1754. Behind the United
Steelworkers tower, overlooking the Monongahelas bank at Stanwix Street
at the corner of Fort Pitt Boulevard, stands the former world headquarters of
Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The dark gray anodized aluminum slab
for what was then one of Pittsburghs corporate mainstays was less progres
sive in design than the same companys research centers built in the 1950s
and 1960s at Churchill and Monroeville. Nonetheless, Westinghouse was
technically distinguished by its pioneering integration of the lighting, heating,
and airconditioning systems and by having the worlds first talking elevators,
developed by Westinghouse, of course.

Riverfront Center, at the opposite corner of Stanwix Street and Fort Pitt
Boulevard, takes a more informal approach to corporate architecture: a skewed
hexagon wrapped in sunscreens of Italian travertine. The appearance of sun
screens in Pittsburgh marked the final confirmation of the efficacy of its
stringent pollution controls: in preRenaissance Pittsburgh, few people wor
ried about overexposure to the sun.
First Side is a finely scaled district comprising the dozen blocks along the
Monongahela waterfront from Stanwix to Grant streets and from Fort Pitt
Boulevard to the Boulevard of the Allies. Its western end, between Stanwix
and Market streets, follows John Campbells provisional plan of 1764. The
layout of First Side was shaped a second time by the Great Fire of 1845,
which leveled most of it, and a third time by the enlargement of Second
Avenue into the Boulevard of the Allies, in 1922. The resulting traffic flow cut
First Side off from the rest of Downtown, which helped preserve it. Its richly
detailed shops and warehouses, with dramatic views of the Monongahela
River and Mount Washington, are now being enhanced by 151 FirstSide, an
eighteenstory tower on the waterfront that was the first new condominium
in the Golden Triangle since the Pittsburgh Renaissance.
Architecturally, the most consistent block remaining from the old Golden
Triangle is the 100 block of Market Street between the Boulevard of the Allies
and First Avenue. Here, except for two gaps, both sides of the street are
packed with commercial structures that have residential lofts on the top
floors. The buildings are largely mid and late
nineteenthcentury substitutes
for shops and warehouses that were lost in the fire of 1845.
Whatever fate held in store for Pittsburgh in 1784, surveyor George
Woods was sure it would be linked to the Monongahela, so he drew most of
his 490 lots as narrow strips on the numbered avenues parallel to the Monon
gahela. In consequence, scores of First Sides towers have double faades that
stretch from one avenue to another. This feature is particularly evident in the
200 block of Fort Pitt Boulevard, between Market and Wood streets, where a
dozen of the best old commercial buildings front on both the Monongahela
and First Avenue. For a hundred years, until 1955, the riverbank was a single
broad levee, where steamboats would pick up and disgorge passengers and
freight. The steamboat and barge trade was so voluminous at Pittsburgh that
for a century the city claimed to be the worlds busiest inland port; in some
quarters that claim persists.
The Conestoga Building at the corner of Fort Pitt Boulevard and W ood
Street got its name from the westward pioneers who bought covered wagons
in the Conestoga Valley of Lancaster County and then brought them across the

Alleghenies to Pittsburgh, where they embarked by boat for the West. Though
shorn of its elaborate cornice, the Conestoga Building survives as one of the
oldest steelframe buildings in town.
Most of the nearby structures on the riverfront predate the Conestoga by
a generation, and several feature castiron fronts. Two examples of the latter
are 235 and 239 Fort Pitt, where iron elements were bolted over traditional
brick and wood faades. Closer to the Point, at number 231, is an elegantly
restored Italianate brick and stone faade. The old fourstory warehouse at
227 Fort Pitt Boulevard now stands as a contemporary evocation of the oriel
fronts or narrow bay windows that once overlooked many of Pittsburghs
streets a century ago.
Wood Street unfolds its architectural character block by block from the
Monongahela to Liberty Avenue, offering excellent examples of architectural
styles popular after the Great Fire of 1845. One block in from the river, at the
corner of Wood Street and First Avenue, stand four BeauxArts skyscrapers
(two with matching faades on the Boulevard of the Allies), which in their
gravitas suggest Pittsburghs consciousness of being midway between Chicago
and New Y ork, with the power of the first tempered by the urbanity of the
second. At 101103 Wood Street there survives another of Pittsburghs cast
iron fronts, this one from about 1860. Despite a lifeless retrofitting in the
1980s, the ironstamped Gothic faade provided some inspiration for the
design of the neighboring WoodAllies Garage on the Boulevard of the Allies.
That ninelevel steeldeck cage begins with a red neoRomanesque brick base
and ends as a parody of the fake Gothic pinnacles of
PPG down the block.
After two blocks that are predominantly BeauxArts in character, W ood
Street switches its architectural code at the intersection with Boule
vard of the
Allies to Art Deco in the twentyonestory main building of Point Park
University (the university uses Wood Street as the central promenade of its
urban campus). What failed once as an athletic club and again as a hotel
today succeeds as a leading center for the performing arts. With thirtyfive
hundred students, Point Park University is a major component of the Golden
Triangle educational offerings. An estimated forty thousand students can be
found Downtown on weekdays, a projection that is accurate if it also encom
passes Duquesne University, on the edge of Downtown.
The blocks farther inland introduce other architectural styles: late inter
national style for the
YWCA at Third Avenue, and midVictorian for a set of
storefronts beyond Fourth Avenue at 409, 411, 413415, and 417 Wood Street.
The second to last of these has been the home of Weldins stationers since
1883; the current classically inspired faade is a redesign from 1905.

he construction in 19791984 of a world headquarters for PPG
Industries had significant impact not just on the lower blocks of
Third and Fourth avenues but for the whole of Downtown. PPG
Place occupies five and a half acres in a complex of eight elements that occupy
or touch six city blocks. The central element is the halfacre open plaza, with
a fortystory glass tower in the center and five uniformly detailed lowrise
structures around it. Between the tower and the Gateway Center complex
on Stanwix Street lies the threestory Wintergarden atrium, while a second
atrium below Two
PPG Place is home to restaurants and specialty shops.
Everything is sheathed in uniform mirror glass, with twenty thousand pieces
of silver PPG Solarban in the tower alone. In winter, the outdoor plaza
becomes a skating rink; the rest of the year children enjoy the userfriendly
water feature fountains around the central obelisk.
The creation of PPG Place in 1984 was an American corporations out
standing act of generosity toward its home city. Pittsburgh Plate Glass was
founded half a block away in 1883 by John Pitcairn and John B. Ford. T oday,
it is the largest producer of glass in the world, as well as a giant in paints, plas
tics, and chemicals. When the company considered building a headquarters
tower near its birthplace on Market Street, it knew that it would be relatively
easy to buy only the half acre it needed. But what PPG really wanted was to
upgrade the whole district in the manner of Rockefeller Center, so it pur
chased an area ten times larger than needed for its own building. It was a
daring move, considering the financial and political risks involved. Another
daring move was the selection of Philip Johnsons unconventional Post
modern Gothic design for the PPG office tower. It marked only the second
time in the postwar era (after Johnsons design for the ATT headquarters in
New Y ork) that an American corporation had chosen fantasy over the staid
International School Style for its public image.
The obvious precedent of the PPG design is the Victoria T ower at the
Houses of Parliament in London, though it is only about half the height of
PPGs 635 feet. There was also a local model: the Cathedral of Learning at the
University of Pittsburgh. PPGs tower is a brilliant  apparition when seen from
outside the Triangle, for example, from West Park on the North Side. Unlike
the Cathedral of Learning, which has a rich variety of surface and texture, the
PPG tower tends to the monotonous at close range. The interior, with its
soaring lobby and repetitive arches, is visually unyielding, although hand
some with its deepred glass paneling. Despite these blemishes,

was one of the best twentiethcentury additions to the Pittsburgh skyline.
Those few who are truly unhappy with the glass tower should not throw
stones, especially inside the lobby, where closedcircuit television cameras
watch from behind oneway glass.
In the last three decades of the nineteenth century, profits from oil, iron,
glass, coal, coke, and steel made Pittsburgh second only to New Y ork in terms
of amassed capital. The twoblock stretch of Fourth Avenue from
PPG Place
up to Smithfield Street, intersected by Wood Street, was once home to the
dozen banks that stored this capital. Pittsburgh still has high importance as a
financial center, but the oil and stock exchanges and most of the banks that
made Fourth Avenue an erstwhile rival to Wall Street were torn down years
ago. The most distinguished of these vanished structures was Frank Furnesss
quirky but lovable Farmers Deposit National Bank as well as the Bank of
Pittsburgh, the latter a close approximation of the New Y ork Stock Exchange.
Constructed in 1896, the Bank of Pittsburgh came down in the 1940s, although
its columns survive in Jefferson Memorial Cemetery in suburban Pleasant Hills.
As the oldest commercial building and the only externally intact Greek
Revival structure in Downtown today, the Burke Building at 209 Fourth
Avenue has seen it all. Built in 1836, and for a time serving as a bank, it stood
for a decade before the Great Fire skirted it by a few feet in 1845. The build
ings owners were the Irishborn lawyers Robert and Andrew Burke; their
architect, John Chislett, was born in England in 1800 and schooled himself in
the Neoclassical traditions seen in the buildings of Bath. Chislett came to
Pittsburgh around 1833 and was the citys dominant architect during the
midnineteenth century. The Burke Building today resembles a domestic more
than a commercial design: a brick structure faced in sandstone, Doric col
umns at the door, and a foursquare plan with fireplaces and a central stair
hall. With windows elongated almost to doors in the manner popularized by
Thomas Jefferson, it is uncompromisingly elegant.
The trio of the BenedumTrees, Investment, and Arrott buildings on
Fourth Avenue just below Wood might recall the fortified towers of medieval
Bologna or San Gimignano. The rhythm for the group was set by the
Arrott, at the corner of Fourth and Wood. Its designer, Frederick Osterling
(18651934), was both prolific and quarrelsome, but he was a generally
brilliant designer in Pittsburgh for nearly half a century. His range of styles
included Romanesque, Classical Revival, and modern Gothic. Osterlings
design for an insurance magnate demonstrates the usual academic sequence
of a largescale base intended for retail
purposes, then a shaft of office floors
in rusticated brick patterning, and a cap of four stories with tall arched

windows and an exuberant copper cornice. The lobby is an equally impressive
mix of
marble, mosaic, and brass.
Three years after Osterling designed the Arrott, the Machesney tower
rose at 221 Fourth Avenue; it was later renamed the BenedumTrees Building
after the oilmen Michael Benedum and Joseph Trees bought it. At nineteen
stories, BenedumTrees was only slightly lower than the Arrott, and it clearly
responded both to the Arrott and to the nowvanished Bank of Pittsburgh in
its dramatic base of Corinthian columns and oriel windows, an aggressively
vertical terracotta shaft, and an enormous overhanging entablature complete
with lions and florid curved brackets. The Investment Building at 239 Fourth
Avenue went up in the 1920s, making it a generation younger than the towers
left and right of it. Its brick shaft is a total abstraction without ornament,
but at the top the corners are sliced away to reveal a set of elegant obelisks,
powerful enough to catch the eye of Philip Johnson when he designed his
Neo
classical obelisk for PPG Place down the block.
Point Park University Center is an adaptive reuse of a group of six banks
that once clustered together in the 400 block of Wood and up Fourth and
Forbes avenues. The first two banks were the Freehold Building and the Real
Estate Trust Company on Fourth Avenue, both from the 1890s. These were
joined at the corner of Fourth and Wood in 1901 by the Peoples Savings
Bank, a fifteenstory tower that mirrors the Arrott tower across Wood Street.
It might be called competent rather than remarkable except for the brilliantly
handled semicircular stairwell inside and the raised brick panels that are
randomly scattered on the exterior, giving the building the appearance of a
decaying Roman ruin. The banks most delicious feature is its two dramatic
reliefs of industrious bees, easily inspected from the sidewalk.
In 1902, the Colonial Trust Company cut sideways through the block to
create a fourth building, with twin Renaissancestyle faades on Fourth and
Forbes avenues; what was supposedly the worlds longest bank lobby ran in
between. In 1926, the dual faades became a trio when the lobby was extended
as a T shape and fronted with a severe Ionic pediment at 414 Wood. The sixth
and last piece of the puzzle fell into place the next year, when a new building
linked the Wood Street faades of the Peoples Bank tower to the Colonial
Trust. In 1976, prominent Argentinaborn designer Rodolfo Machado, who
was working for the
IKM Partnership and taught at Carnegie Mellon, came
up with a cool, minimalist design for a shopping mall project that would amal
gamate these buildings. The design scheme was widely praised but under
funded, and an inexpensive alternative design was used instead. When that
mall went bankrupt, the complex underwent a final renovation in 1997 and

emerged as the Point Park University Center. What sounds like a depressing
chronicle has ended on an uplifting note: the interior columns and the lilting
volumes of the interior are just short of breath
taking. A grand staircase on the
right enables viewers to inspect the magnificent goldpaneled ceiling.
Fourth Avenue is marked by a particularly pleasing visual consistency
today. Because of that quality, twentyfour of its buildings were incorporated
into a National Register of Historic Places district in 1985. The south side of
the 300 block of Fourth, from Wood to Smithfield streets, originally had a
sequence of four banks and a newspaper office. The three turnofthe
century
banks at 306, 312, and 324 Fourth were the Union National Bank, the
Commonwealth Trust, and Keystone Bank
all predictably sober except for
the beautifully articulated Keystone Bank, where a light court was recessed in
the faade and garlanded above by a bridgelike arch. The three towers were
eventually amalgamated into the Union National Bank, whose core structure
was converted into the Carlyle, a luxury condominium residence, in 2007.
The first fourteen floors of standard units and four top floors of doublesized
apartments sold at such a satisfying rate that the developers purchased the
Commonwealth Building for conversion into an additional sixty residences.
The upper end of the same Fourth Avenue block is considerably less
sober. The evolving social and business attitudes in mid and late nineteenth
century America can be discerned by comparing the efflorescence of the
earlier Dollar Bank, at the upper corner intersecting Smithfield Street, to the
straitlaced Union National, at the lower corner intersecting Wood. Dollar
Bank, dating from 1871, with wings added in 1906, is the ultimate in public
relations architecture; it is a building that is all doorway. The red sandstone
faade features a sumptuous pair of double columns guarding the door with
the help of two dozing lions. Its designer, Isaac Hobbs, was a fashionable
Philadelphia architect and architectural publisher whose conception of the bank
shows at once what was both splendid and hopeless in Victorian architecture.
The ornament is vigorous, learned, and delightful, but the essential lines of
the faade are drowned by the Baroque and Italianate details.
The imbalance of the part and the whole, so characteristic of American
architecture after the Civil War, was the problem that would occupy H. H.
Richardson, who was just beginning his architectural career when Dollar
Bank went up. Frederick Osterling, Richardsons longdistance pupil (there
is no indication the two designers ever met), captured the simplifying ability
of his master reasonably well in the fourstory Times Building alongside
Dollar Bank, at 336 Fourth Avenue. The patron here was the publisher, civic
powerhouse, and

newspaper, the Pittsburgh Times. Now sensitively restored inside, this eight
story Romanesque Revival tower has faades on both Fourth and Third
avenues, with the former enlivened by particularly fine grotesque carvings that
are replicated in the dimly lit interior of the building.
What was once a solid line of buildings on the north side of the 300 block
of Fourth Avenue is now broken by a parking lot, but even so, this view shows
how good architects can make their structures distinctive without destroying the
wider unity of a city block. The flagship of this upper block is the Standard Life
Building at 345 Fourth Avenue, dressed in deep red Roman bricks and terra
cotta plaques. The Standard Life skyscraper talks to Peoples Savings at the
lower end of the block with its exaggerated detail on the upper floors, particu
larly the colossal arch stones set over the top windows. T o the left of Standard
Life is the earliest building of this cluster, the Fidelity Trust Building from 1889,
at 341 Fourth. It begins well with a base of two massive arched doors and a
dwarf
mezzanine of three rectangular openings with colonettes, but in the
upper floors the faade changes rhythm at almost every level, as though slices
of a half dozen different buildings had been stacked atop one another.
In 1898, a decade after the construction of the Fidelity Trust Building,
Henry Clay Frick summoned the dean of American architects, Daniel Burnham,
to build the small Union Trust Company (now the Engineers Society) at 337
Fourth, immediately next door. This little Greek temple, with a podium of
deeply channeled blocks below and severe Doric columns above, was the first
of eleven projects that Burnham drew up for Pittsburgh
more than he
created for any city except his native Chicago. Next door to Burnhams monu
ment, local architect Charles M. Bartberger built a considerably more accom
plished structure for his Industrial Bank, at 333 Fourth Avenue. Bartberger
was the Germantrained son of the prolific Germanborn Charles F . Bartberger,
who in terms of volume was one of Pittsburghs top architects from the 1850s
to the 1880s. Charles M. in turn trained his own son, Edward W . Bartberger,
who lived until 1968. Thus, three Bartberger generations practiced architec
ture in Pittsburgh for well over a century.
Charles M. Bartberger appears to have thought carefully about
eighteenth
century Neoclassical precedents before crafting a BeauxArts synthesis for the
Industrial Bank. The architectural languages of the Englishman Nicholas
Hawksmoor, the Frenchman ClaudeNicholas Ledoux, and the German
Peter Speeth seem to predominate. For
dramatic effect, Bartberger capri
ciously overscaled elements like the
triglyphs, some of which suddenly and
irrationally droop down onto the masonry surface. Every element of the faade
speaks as well as looks the part it was meant to play: the public banking hall

below is marked by the twostory sweep of the entrance arch, and the board
room above is denoted by fat colonettes. Finally, Bartberger was subtle and
amusing in his contextual references. The single perky acroterion (stylized
plant leaf) on his pediment mimics the five that Burnham used with dour
seriousness next door, while the combination of arch below and dwarf mezza
nine above is a tribute to the same feature in the Fidelity Trust, two doors
away. The Industrial Bank design was Bartbergers finest hour. Perhaps he
knew it; at any rate, when the opportunity came, he seized it.

he name Smithfield Street constitutes a tribute to the little  remembered
Revolutionary War captain Devereux Smith (17351799), who was a
personal friend of George Washington and operated a successful
Indian trading firm with Ephriam Douglass. Smithfield began as an ordinary
crossstreet like Wood, but when a bridge connected it to the South Side in
1818 it became richer and larger in scale, and its small, early buildings were
cannibalized by bigger ones. There are, nonetheless, some worthy survivors.
One is the elegant Adamstyle Americus Club (now the Pitt Building) at the
corner of Allies and Smithfield. Built in 1918 in the English Neoclassical
Style of the late eighteenth century, the clubhouses left side was amputated
four years later when the narrow old Second Avenue was transformed into
the Boulevard of the Allies. Two other lively survivors stand at 110 and 112
Smithfield. The first is a High Victorian Gothic commercial block, dated 1881,
which presents itself with all the pugnacity of a piece of Eastlake furniture. It
is a marvelous sight in the sparkle of its blue, red, and light brown tiles. The
second standout is the Lshaped former home of Engine Company No. 2, a
former firehouse from 1900 that introduces an Art Nouveau flavor to the
neigh
bor
hood. It stands three stories tall, with a bleached white granite base
and two stories of beautifully dressed sandstone.
The intersection of Smithfield Street and Fifth Avenue is the busiest in
town and is among the most significant for its architecture. The prime build
ing here is Macys Department Store (Kaufmanns until 2006), while on the
three other corners stand the old Mellon Bank headquarters, the early high
rise Park Building, and the SwindallRust headquarters, formerly the Frank
Seder Department Store, which provides a Classical counterweight to some
of its more architecturally unruly neighbors. The elaborate clock at the Macys
corner proclaims the importance of the store: at close to a million square feet,
its significance is not merely architectural but social and even cultural.

The Macys store offers a prime recollection of three figures tightly
woven into the fabric of Pittsburgh: Edgar Kaufmann Sr., Benno Janssen,
and Frank Lloyd Wright. Brothers Morris, Henry, Jacob, and Isaac Kaufmann
arrived in Pittsburgh from Germany in the years after 1860, and by 1871,
they had a flourishing trade on the South Side. Around 1877, the Kaufmanns
moved their store to this prestigious corner, and in 1885, the year Morriss
son Edgar was born, they enlarged it into the Big Store. The corner of the
store now standing at Smithfield and Forbes was built for the Kaufmanns
in 1898 by Charles Bickel and borrows motifs from the Romanesque and
Classical Revivals, as well as from the Chicago school of Louis Henry Sullivan
and his colleagues.
Edgar Kaufmann Sr. (18851955), universally known as E. J., took charge
of the firm in 1913 and had the socially prominent architect Benno Janssen
design a new terracotta block to replace the store built in 1885 at the corner
of Smithfield and Fifth. A few years later Kaufmann
purchased the first of
fifteen hundred acres for a country retreat near Pittsburgh that Frank Lloyd
Wright made world famous as Fallingwater. Janssen designed an extension
of the store on Forbes Avenue at Cherry Way a few years later. In 1930, he
modernized its ground floor interior in Art Deco Style, with piers of black
Carrara glass and murals by Boardman Robinson. Critics regarded it as
the most beautiful store in America
and the most profitable. It marked
Kaufmanns first step toward Modernism.
The glass and murals are long gone from KaufmannsMacys, and so is
the office that Wright built for Kaufmann in 1936 and 1937 (contemporary
with Fallingwater) on the stores tenth floor. Wright designed the furniture
and paneling for this sumptuous suite, including a cypress plywood mural,
and he selected the wall fabrics himself. The office served Kaufmann for
twenty years, until his death in 1955, after which his son Edgar Jr. had it
dismantled and shipped to Londons Victoria and Albert Museum, where
it is a star attraction.
Architect Benno Janssen (18741964) is undeservedly forgotten today,
even though a recent biography offers excellent coverage of his body of work.
Janssen was born to a GermanAmerican family in St. Louis, enrolled at the
cole des BeauxArts in Paris in 1902, and soon after came to work in
Pittsburgh. He was the best academic designer Pittsburgh ever had, on a par
with or superior to Carrère  Hastings, Horace Trumbauer, David Adler,
Charles Platt, and the host of others who took care of wealthy Americans
architectural needs before and after World War I. Kaufmann was Janssens
most loyal client. He gave him nearly a dozen commissions and even lived in

Janssens own home in Squirrel Hill before ordering a new house from him
in Fox Chapel.
Janssens career reminds us of Kaufmanns importance as a patron of
architecture for many years before he built Fallingwater. Kaufmann commis
sioned buildings from Janssen, Wright, the Bauhausassociated Richard Neutra
(for Kaufmanns Palm Springs winter retreat, the out
standing example of
American midcentury modernism), Joseph Urban (a swimming pool at the
Irene Kaufmann Settlement on the Hill), and the important Pittsburgh archi
tects Mitchell  Ritchey (for the Civic Arena in the lower Hill District). After
Janssen retired in the 1930s, Kaufmann switched his architectural allegiance
to Wright, and together the two men planned Fallingwater in 1934 and 1935.
Kaufmanns architectural patronage reminds us in turn of how impor
tant Frank Lloyd Wright (18671959) was to Pittsburgh and vice versa.
Kaufmann was Wrights outstanding patron. Their partnership lasted twenty
years and yielded nearly a dozen uncompleted projects in addition to those
that were realized. The unfinished projects included Kaufmanns sponsor
ship of Wrights Broadacre City model, which was exhibited at Kaufmanns
immediately after being shown in 1935 at Rockefeller Center; Wrights exten
sive sketches for a megastructure at the Point; the Rhododendron Chapel,
meant to rise on the grounds of Fallingwater; another winter house (Wright
intended it to outshine the one already built by Neutra); a hillside apartment
on Mount Washington; and a planetarium and parking garage next to
Kaufmanns store. Though disappointingly little came of it, the partnership
of Wright and Kaufmann was one of the most intense collaborations of artist
and patron in the history of American art.

ifth Avenue was for years Downtowns primary retail and entertain

photographs of Fifth Avenue will never return, but in the meantime, there is
heartening progress, with several excellent buildings waiting to be reutilized.
The Park Building, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield, is a design
triumph by the thendean of American architects, George B. Post. Completed
in 1896, it was the third or fourth of Pittsburghs steelframe skyscrapers.
Posts local patrons were David and William Park, operators of the Black

1805, and soon thereafter it cast the cannons that Commodore Perry fired on
Lake Erie during the War of 1812 as well as the ones Andrew Jackson used at
the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.
For the Parks, Post recast the design for his earlier Havemeyer Building
in New Y ork, but the Pittsburgh variant was substantially more interesting.
The base is simplified and strong, and the nine identical middle floors are
well articulated through corner windows. But the joy of the Park Building is
in the thirty telemones or Atlases that are (seemingly) crushed by the weight of
the top cornice. The telemones are cast in terra cotta and were originally poly
chromed. Pittsburgh has always loved them, perhaps because these mytho
logical creatures straining at their work symbolize the hard physical labor that
for so long characterized the citys work force.
The 300 block of Fifth Avenue, from Smithfield down to Wood Street,
was for a century home to another of Pittsburghs innovative skyscrapers. At
335 Fifth Avenue master piano salesman Samuel Hamilton erected the ten
story Hamilton Building in 1889 to a height of 125 feet. The building was a
traditional masonry structure, not steel frame, but it was the last word in late
Victorian commercial expression. A few doors down from where the piano
skyscraper once stood is the structure that ate it up: Piatt Place, at the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street. This was originally the Lazarus Department
Store. When it went up in 1998, it was the first new American downtown
department store in decades, though it failed almost immediately. The adap
tive reuse given the structure in 2007 yielded another sixtyfive luxury
condo
miniums to house a growing Downtown population. The rest of the
complex features streetlevel boutiques and restaurants.

The final blocks of Fifth Avenue, from Wood Street to Liberty, offer an
intriguing mix of late nineteenth and late twentiethcentury Pittsburgh. On
the streets south side are arrayed a number of hearty survivors from the early
retail days. The doubleunit commercial structure at 214218 Fifth Avenue is
an Italianate castiron front from the 1860s or 1870s, with large glass panes
and interlacing floral designs stamped out in iron molds. Farther down the
street stand two particularly good examples of retail and office blocks from
the early twentieth century: the Buhl Building at 205 Fifth Avenue from 1913,
decked out in ebullient blue and cream terracotta plaques, and the Diamond
Building (formerly the Diamond National Bank), from 1904, at the inter
section of Fifth Avenue and Liberty. The latter rises twelve stories high and
is topped by the most dramatic BeauxArts copper cornice in the city. The
handsome block bends backward from its central entrance to fit into one of
the triangular lots embodied in the quirky city plan of 1784.

T
he closing of the tail end of Oliver Avenue between Wood and Liberty
in the 1960s created a trapezoid block on which now rise four tall
towers. The earliest of these was One Oliver Plaza, a thirtyeightstory
glassandsteel box standing on a base of dark granite at the Sixth Avenue
angle of the trapezoid. At the Fifth Avenue end of the block stands One
PNC
Plaza, built as the Pittsburgh National Bank Building in 1972. This replaced
an Italian Renaissance tower that Daniel Burnham erected for the predeces
sor First National Bank. One PNC Plaza was conceived as a glass slab, with a
service core that is clad in pearlgray granite. It does its job well, but at thirty
stories, the current building is merely three floors higher than the 1912 tower
it replaced, leading one to question the notion of architectural obsolescence.
Two PNC Plaza was squeezed between the One Oliver and One PNC
Plaza towers in 1976. Although handicapped by weak linkage to the streets in
front and behind them, the two interlocking mirrorglass octagons of Two
PNC manage an elegant solution to an overbuilt site. The octagonal geometry
of these twin towers relates well to the polygonal shape of the former Meyer
and Jonasson department store, the lowrise neighbor at 606 Liberty Avenue.
Meyer and Jonasson got its odd shape because it conformed to the old course
of Oliver Avenue before it was filled in below Wood Street.

he history of Pittsburgh is written out in buildings in every part of the
Golden Triangle, as seen in First Side and in the palatial skyscrapers
on Fourth Avenue that still speak of Pittsburghs wealth in the early
twentieth century. Visitors nonetheless get their best feel for old Pittsburgh in
and around Market Square. Much of the squares pedestrian traffic comes
from its utility as a walkway between
PNC Plaza, a block to the north, and
PPG Place, a block to the south. But even in its current weakened state    we
can always hope for a better one
Market Square can still claim to be the heart
of Downtown.
The square was the sole open space in George Woodss 1784 street plan.
Over the years it was the site of a courthouse, a city hall, and a sequence of
market buildings that came down only in 1961. Historically the square (west
ern Pennsylvanians traditionally call a space like this a diamond) was always
meant to be paved and built on, not green and open as the present pseudo
restoration has it. A better alternative would be to get rid of the quadrants,
cover the central square with glass over a gigantic neon map of Pittsburgh,
and invite citizens to dance there every night.
The diamonds perimeter buildings pretty much summarize Pittsburghs
architectural history: Gallaghers Pub and Ryans Ale House (2 and 3 Market
Place) from the Civil War era, a fragment of glassy
PPG Place at the south
west quadrant, and a restaurant decked out in Tudor Revival. Two of the
better citizens of the square are Nicholas Coffee and the Landmark T avern,
which dates to 1902. The former displays a tall Chippendale front crowned
by a neon coffee cup with steam wafting out; this joking reference to Philip
Johnsons Chippendaletopped Sony Building in New Y ork serves also as an
efficient device to give height to the faade and elegance to an urban gathering
place that sorely needs it.
The best recent news for Market Square is the Downtown
YMCA (along
with apartments overhead) taking over the shuttered G. C. Murphy store where
Market Square fronts on Forbes Avenue (the rebuilt complex goes by the
redundant name of Market Square Place). Like the new housing and dining

T
he creation of Mellon Square (bounded by Smithfield Street, William
Penn Place, and Oliver and Sixth avenues) was an inspired mix of
altruism and selfinterest. The Mellons had been a presence in Down
town since Judge Thomas Mellon resigned from the bench in 1869 and
opened a bank, saying that any man who could not get rich in Pittsburgh
within ten years was a fool. Mellons first bank was a masonry building at 514
Smithfield Street, roughly opposite what is now the square, but in 1873, the
judge put up a more imposing castiron front that featured a statue of his
hero, Benjamin Franklin.
Serene and majestic on the outside, Mellon Bank has covered the block
of Smithfield between Fifth Avenue and Mellon Square since 1924, but it has
been destroyed inside. The long and airy banking hall, one of Pittsburghs
prime architectural and social spaces, vanished in 1999 when its shortsighted
owners and an overeager city hall let Lord and T aylor rebuild it as a faux
Manhattan emporium. Fifteen tons of Italian marble in each of the Ionic
columns was smashed and hauled away, leaving just their steel cores. Gone
was the vast basilicalike space of the hall, sixtyfive feet tall and two hundred
feet long; gone were the aisles coffered and painted deep blue with speckles
of gold leaf; gone was any hint that the worlds earliest venture capitalists once
operated out of Pittsburgh. Befitting its place as the heart of Mellon opera
tions, the hall commemorated A. W . and R. B. Mellon with portraits and
inscriptions on the walls of the vault. After Lord and T aylors quick demise a
few years later, the now banal interior awaits some new use.
Banking was always just the visible tip of the Mellon money machine.
Their investments in coal, coke, steel and its chemical byproducts, oil, alumi
num, real estate, and transportation were far more lucrative than what they
earned as bankers. Until the appearance of megabillionaires in computers
and securities in the 1980s and 1990s, the Mellons of Pittsburgh were among
the wealthiest families in the world, in a league with the Fords, the Rockefellers,
and the du Ponts.
The family headquartered its business ventures on Smithfield Street
until three of those firms required their own headquarters. At the end of the
1920s, Gulf and Koppers moved two blocks away, to Seventh Avenue. Alcoa

tried to bolt from the family circle and build in New Y ork after World War II,
but Richard King Mellon had not backed the Pittsburgh Renaissance only to
see it scorned at home. He quashed the move to New Y ork, and he and his
more worldly cousin Paul Mellon conceived a grand complex that would
house Alcoa and the expanded bank operations in twin towers facing each
other across a park. Construction of Mellon Square and its underground
parking garage required demolition of a full city block, but it paid off hand
somely in sight lines to all the surrounding buildings. Apart from creating a
place in which its perimeter buildings might preen, Mellon Square holds up
well as a period piece from the mid1950s, when organic and modern
were words architects could still use without stumbling. The design in Venetian
terrazzo appears today somewhat thin in the manner of the Eisenhower years,
but the trees and fountains have aged well, and Kenneth Snelsons Forest Devil
sculpture in stainlesssteel pipes provides welcome animation.
Around Mellon Square rises a particularly impressive grouping of
twentiethcentury skyscrapers. On the Oliver Avenue or southern edge of the
square rise the Mellon Bank of the 1920s, described above, and Citizens
(originally Mellon) Bank, a postwar financial tower on the upper edge of the
square. On the squares western edge stands the Oliver Building, from 1910,
and at its northwest corner the Heinz 57 Center, headquarters for Heinz
North America. The structure was for decades a Gimbels department store,
and before that Kaufmann  Baers, originally built by some breakaway
Kaufmann cousins to rival the main Kaufmann store. At the corresponding
northeast corner stands what was for years the Philadelphia Traction Company
block, put up in 1902 by the transportation mogul P . A. B. Widener.
All of these perimeter buildings carry architectural distinction, but the
most successful and renowned of them is the Regional Enterprise T ower,
erected in 1953 as the Alcoa Building (the corporation handed it over in 1998
to a consortium of nonprofit organizations). Using aluminum wherever pos
sible, Alcoas thirtystory tower is radically lighter and more efficient than
buildings of comparable size. Its curtain wall was not constructed piece by
piece but prefabricated in aluminum sheets that contained both windows and
the floor zone. The windows swing open in special rubber gaskets, so the
buildings exterior requires minimal cleaning and maintenance. Inside, the
same spirit of radical innovation prevailed: aluminum furniture, aluminum
piping and wiring, aluminum airconditioning ducts, and an airy and fanciful
lobby. This list of distinctions briefly propelled Alcoa to top rank among post
war skyscrapers, but it was evidently too futuristic for the national design
community, which shunned it for thirty years until Richard Meier returned

for the Porter Building. Half a block uphill on Grant Street, it looks (as the

he four blocks north of Mellon Square, marked by several narrow
eighteenthcentury streets, encompass an eclectic mix of architectural
survivors. The most gracious of these is the Allegheny
HYP Club
(formerly the HarvardYalePrinceton Club) on William Penn Place at the
corner of Strawberry Way. It occupies one of the two plain brick rectangles
that were built in 1894 as worker housing, then remodeled in Highstyle
Georgian in 1930 by the academic classicist Edward B. Lee. The
HYP Club
uses only the right block for its clubhouse; the left block houses nonprofit
organizations linked to the adjoining Regional Enterprise T ower.
The end wall of the tiny court that separates the two blocks incorporates
relics from schools back East: two columns salvaged from Appleton Chapel
at Harvard and six stones of uncertain provenance from Princeton and Yale.
Overhead is the fantastic sight of the rose window and aluminum spire of
Smithfield United Church. Until women were admitted to the club in 1980,
only two female guests had been officially entertained there. The actress
Cornelia Otis Skinner was one, Mae West the other. West remarked on the
occasion, Its rather difficult for me to think up things to say to Harvard
YalePrinceton men collectively. Of course, I can think of plenty to say to men
individually.
Neighboring the club and a little downhill from it, at the corner of 620
Smithfield Street and Strawberry Way, stands Smithfield United Church of
Christ, the sixth home of a congregation founded in 1782. This highly suc

School of Applied Design. Hornbostel had excellent credentials: he graduated
from Columbia University in 1891, spent four years at the cole des Beaux
Arts (where he was known as lhomme perspectif for his brilliant drawings),

taught at Columbia, worked for Stanford White, and was runnerup in the
com
petition to design the campus of the University of California at Berkeley.
Though Pittsburgh was his main base, Hornbostel continued as an active
architect in New Y ork through the 1920s. The Hell Gate, Queensboro, and
Manhattan bridges are his most prominent monuments there, but he also
created a campus for Emory University in Atlanta and did civic buildings in
Albany, New Y ork, and on the West Coast.
The contrast of spiritual and mundane values is the key to understand
ing Hornbostels approach to the design of the Smithfield Church. He placed
the church hard against the sidewalk to integrate it uncompromisingly with
the city and used standard industrial materials to erect it: steel, limestone, and
poured and cast concrete. The main floor, right off the street, is not a sanctu
ary but a gym, complete with showers and locker rooms. The congregation
has used it for various purposes over the years, including a daycare center
and a dormitory for the homeless. The sanctuary, one floor up, is rich in its
wood trim, stained glass, and lavish plaster fan vaults. Higher still, on the roof,
Hornbostel used aluminum for his filigree spire
an early use of that mate
rial for structural purposes and an unforgettable vision that parallels the
contemporary Watts T ower in Los Angeles.
A newcomer to Smithfield Street, at number 612, is the Downtown
branch of Carnegie Library, a facility that gives new life to a neglected block.
This small but always crowded library speaks volumes, with
Library in
oversized letters that span the entire height and width of the glass faade.
What animates this end of Smithfield Street even better is a droll mural,
painted in 2006 by Sarah Zeffiro and T om Mosser, at the intersection of
Smithfield and the narrow Strawberry Way, above the Wiener World hotdog
shop. The T wo Andys presents civic heroes Andy Warhol and Andy Carnegie
under hair
dryers, in the most striking of the two dozen murals put up around
Pittsburgh in recent years by the Sprout Fund.
The s ix T hOliver cO rri DO r

hree corridors have left their imprint on the Golden Triangle: the nine
blocks of the Cultural District, along Penn and Liberty avenues; the
collection of government and corporate entities along Grant Street;
and the threeblock stretch of Sixth and Oliver avenues that connects the
Mellon and PNC banking powerhouses. This last corridor is august: it pre
serves memories of the Mellons and the Olivers, the Duquesne Club, two
of Pittsburghs oldest churches, a Brooks Brothers, and a Saks Fifth Avenue.

It is also perfect in its symmetry, with Mellon Square to the east and PNC
Plaza to the west, two Daniel Burnham skyscrapers at the ends of the district,
two venerable churches in the middle, and an Indian burial ground along its
central axis.
The Trinity Church burial ground originated in a small hillock that must
have been one of the few dry spots in the Triangle when the Allegheny River
flooded it each spring. The French, knowing that American Indians had used
it, took the hillock over for their own burials from 1754 to 1758, the years in
which they held Fort Duquesne at the Point. The British and Americans
added more graves, and by the time of the last burial in 1854, about four
thousand recorded bodies and far more unrecorded ones rested there. The
graveyard left its mark on the toponomy of Pittsburgh, too. The French called
the processional way leading to the cemetery the Allée de la Vièrge, for the
Blessed Virgin Mary, but the name Virgin Alley caused sufficient embar
rassment that it was changed in 1904 to Oliver Avenue.
Henry W . Oliver (18401904) was one of the ScotsIrish capitalists who
led Pittsburgh to dominance in the age of industry. His initial firm, founded
in 1863, manufactured nuts and bolts. He reincorporated that firm in 1888
as the Oliver Iron  Steel Company, and he eventually controlled much of
the rich Mesabi iron ore range in northern Minnesota. Oliver reaped millions
from J. P . Morgans buyout of Carnegie Steel in 1901, and he proceeded to
invest it Downtown. Before he died in 1904, he commissioned Daniel Burnham
to build a department store at the lower end of this block. A few years later,
Olivers heirs commissioned the Oliver Building from Burnham as a memo
rial to the industrialist. Burnham produced a wider, deeper, taller version of his
building for H. C. Frick of a few years earlier. Its base of grayish pink granite
Doric columns is well if coldly handled, while the main faade above is a mass
of cream terra cotta covering a full acre and a half on the Smithfield Street
faade alone. The cap to the building consists of three stories of banded
Corinthian pilasters and an exuberant cornice line 347 feet in the air.
The interior decoration of the Oliver Building is carried out with similar
élan: white marble with dark splashes of bronzework in the lobby and
Honduras mahogany trim in the offices upstairs. The heirs were satisfied
enough to ask Burnham for still more buildings, including a memorial bath
house next to the Oliver ironworks on the South Side (still standing, but in
the end designed by another firm). These properties were later capitalized
into the realty holding company that built Oliver Plaza (now absorbed into
PNC Plaza) sixty years later.

When the Penn heirs carved up the town in 1784, the sacredness attached
to the burial ground on Sixth Avenue made it the obvious choice for the three
free lots they doled out to the Episcopal, Presbyterian, and GermanEvangelist
congregations. The Presbyterians and Episcopalians are still on the block; the
German and Evangelist congregations are only a few hundred feet away.
Sixth Avenues Trinity Episcopal Cathedral and First Presbyterian Church
are both monuments with impeccable design pedigrees. Trinitys first and
second churches of 1787 and 1805 were farther down the block, on Liberty
Avenue; the third church was built on this site in 1824 by the rector, John
Henry Hopkins, who published an engraving of his design locally in 1826,
then nationally in his Essay on Gothic Architecture in 1836. The present Trinity
Cathedral was designed forty years later by Gordon Lloyd, an Englishborn
architect from Detroit who had been trained both in the archaeological and
rhetorical variants of the Gothic Revival. The latter taste manifests itself in the
bold massing of the octagonal spire over the Trinity tower. Inside, the feeling
is not English but decidedly American, and the interior assimilates several
features of the late style of Richard Upjohn, to whom the church has occa
sionally been attributed. Trinity is a ravishingly austere building inside, with
compound piers and archivolts of gray stone standing out against the cream
white walls, and deep brown diaphragm arches soar across the nave. If Gordon
Lloyd was this good (not even his obituary
suggested he was), all honor to him!
First Presbyterian Church, on the opposite side of Trinitys graveyard, is
the successor church to one that was redesigned and expanded by Benjamin
Henry Latrobe in 1812 and to a later Gothic Revival design by Charles F .
Bartberger at midcentury. The designer of the present building, Theophilus
P . Chandler Jr., was a practiced Philadelphia architect with excellent social
connections both in that city and in Boston. In Pittsburgh he was the favored
architect of the Thaw family, which resulted in commissions to erect three
Presbyterian churches. The challenge to Chandler in 1905 was that the church
must look good against the backdrop of Trinity while upholding Presby
terianism in the most intensely Presbyterian city in the country. His response
was a much more showy design than Trinitys, with double towers in front
and a
fantastic march of gables and pinnacles on the side aisle flanking the
cemetery. The interior is distinguished by rich and structurally daring wood
work and by fourteen stainedglass windows by Tiffany
out
standing even
in a city that abounds in some of the best stained glass in the country.
Remarkable, too, is what looks to be an apse behind the altar but operates as
a pair of enormous doors that swing open to provide additional space.

The two churches on Sixth Avenue have a host of architecturally pleas
ing neighbors. The openair pulpit in front of First Presbyterian, an unusual
Medieval feature, points directly across the street to the most powerful of
these neighbors, the Duquesne Club. The club moved to this location in 1879,
six years after its founding, and a decade later erected its present Richardsonian
Romanesque brownstone faade. Inside the Duquesne Club are scattered
fiftyfour dining rooms, mainly private suites maintained by major Pittsburgh
corporations. The role played by the club in the development of Pittsburgh
since 1873 can be exaggerated, but not by much. One explanation offered for
the peculiar bunching of skyscrapers in certain parts of the Triangle is that
the corporate
CEOs prefer not to build too far from the Duquesne clubhouse
on Sixth Avenue. In a study of civic leadership in Pittsburgh in 1958, Arnold
J. Auerbach polled the executive committee of the Allegheny Conference on
Community Development, with these results: twentyfour of the twentyfive
members belonged to the Duquesne Club, nineteen to the Melloncentered
Rolling Rock Club at Ligonier, and thirteen to the Fox Chapel Golf Club.
Next door to the Duquesne Club is the former German Savings and
Deposit Bank, now the Granite Building. This Romanesque Revival bank
has to be accounted among the most sumptuously textured buildings in
Pittsburgh, though in the end it becomes a fairly tedious catalogue of all the
shapes and textures granite can assume.
The 300 Sixth Avenue Building, at the corner of Wood, completes the
Sixth Avenue sequence as the counterpart terracotta slab to the Oliver
Building at the top of the block. It served for a generation as McCreerys
Department Store, then from the 1940s to the 1960s as the Spear  Company
store. Not having a particularly strong design to begin with, the building was
further compromised by an unsympathetic rehabilitation. The new base did,
however, include one superb feature: The Puddler, an illuminated stained
glass mural of an ironworker. It was installed in 1942 and today is one of the
prime icons of the city.
